However, for some reason I felt uneasy and separated the two to get a better understanding of the whole picture. I spoke to the male and he told me they were on their way to visit their parents in Mexico. I went over to the young girl who was around 11 years old and she stuck with her guns that they were brother and sister. I go back to the guy and just gave him a look of I know the truth. So he just lowered his head and said ‚ÄúI thought I could get away with it.‚Äù Starts telling me everything. He was working close to where the little girl lived, he befriended her and then made her his girlfriend. They had been dating for 3 months and were on their way to Mexico to get married. I don‚Äôt know how I kept my composure from punching him in the face. Little girl stuck to her guns and kept saying they were siblings until She saw he was being arrested. She then started crying and saying she loved him. I called her parents who lived in The east coast and told them about the situation. The parents didn‚Äôt even know she was gone because she had told them she was staying the night at a friends house the day before. The parents were so appreciative that we caught that POS before he took her with him into Mexico."

Also only 15 minutes from my driveway to the drop-off/pickup lanes of the international airport. I love where I live now for it's convience, but every year I'm here I look forward to being able to move further north away from the craziness of living on top of everyone else.

"How do you spend New Year‚Äôs Eve happily *alone,* at home? ","I‚Äôm currently home alone and pretty much happy with the situation I‚Äôm in. Called everyone to wish them best wishes, vaped some good weed and am now finally watching some movies I have been wanting to see for quite some time. The key is, to actively not wanting to give a fuck because you‚Äôre ‚Äòsupposed‚Äô to be with friends and family at a night like this. Lemme tel ya: each and every year before this one I spent New Years eve with friends and family and didn‚Äôt like it one bit. I don‚Äôt drink, and while smoking/vaping weed is ok with everyone, it was still mocked into oblivion and so I held back and didn‚Äôt get high. Didn‚Äôt drink either. Those nights were usually spent with the first half of the evening playing games with my drunk family, and the other half making sure nobody does some stupid shit (like walking straight into a stack of pellets to take a load off that was about to explode with fireworks). I did not enjoy it. So this year I decided to not give a fuck and do things my way. I stayed home (it‚Äôs 01:30 here) watching movies with my headphones on, and having a good time! I did not freeze my ass off, my coat isn‚Äôt damaged by fireworks or stained with alcohol and I‚Äôm totally ok with that. üëå I thought it would suck too, but once you decide that it‚Äôs not going to, it won‚Äôt."
"How do you spend New Year‚Äôs Eve happily *alone,* at home? ","Watch a movie? Read a book? Cook dinner for your self? Drink a glass of wine, or the bottle?

"How do you spend New Year‚Äôs Eve happily *alone,* at home?

What is the most interesting way someone can answer this question? ,"&amp;#x200B; &gt;July the 14th, 1861 &amp;#x200B; &gt; Washington D.C. &amp;#x200B; &gt; My very dear Sarah: &amp;#x200B; &gt; The indications are very strong that we shall move in a few days‚Äîperhaps tomorrow. Lest I should not be able to write you again, I feel impelled to write lines that may fall under your eye when I shall be no more. Our movement may be one of a few days duration and full of pleasure‚Äîand it may be one of severe conflict and death to me. Not my will, but thine O God, be done. If it is necessary that I should fall on the battlefield for my country, I am ready. I have no misgivings about, or lack of confidence in, the cause in which I am engaged, and my courage does not halt or falter. I know how strongly American Civilization now leans upon the triumph of the Government, and how great a debt we owe to those who went before us through the blood and suffering of the Revolution. And I am willing‚Äîperfectly willing‚Äîto lay down all my joys in this life, to help maintain this Government, and to pay that debt. But, my dear wife, when I know that with my own joys I lay down nearly all of yours, and replace them in this life with cares and sorrows‚Äîwhen, after having eaten for long years the bitter fruit of orphanage myself, I must offer it as their only sustenance to my dear little children‚Äîis it weak or dishonorable, while the banner of my purpose floats calmly and proudly in the breeze, that my unbounded love for you, my darling wife and children, should struggle in fierce, though useless, contest with my love of country. Sarah, my love for you is deathless, it seems to bind me to you with mighty cables that nothing but Omnipotence could break; and yet my love of Country comes over me like a strong wind and bears me irresistibly on with all these chains to the battlefield. The memories of the blissful moments I have spent with you come creeping over me, and I feel most gratified to God and to you that I have enjoyed them so long. And hard it is for me to give them up and burn to ashes the hopes of future years, when God willing, we might still have lived and loved together and seen our sons grow up to honorable manhood around us. I have, I know, but few and small claims upon Divine Providence, but something whispers to me‚Äîperhaps it is the wafted prayer of my little Edgar‚Äîthat I shall return to my loved ones unharmed. If I do not, my dear Sarah, never forget how much I love you, and when my last breath escapes me on the battlefield, it will whisper your name. Forgive my many faults, and the many pains I have caused you. How thoughtless and foolish I have often been! How gladly would I wash out with my tears every little spot upon your happiness, and struggle with all the misfortune of this world, to shield you and my children from harm. But I cannot. I must watch you from the spirit land and hover near you, while you buffet the storms with your precious little freight, and wait with sad patience till we meet to part no more. But, O Sarah! If the dead can come back to this earth and flit unseen around those they loved, I shall always be near you; in the brightest day and in the darkest night‚Äîamidst your happiest scenes and gloomiest hours‚Äîalways, always; and if there be a soft breeze upon your cheek, it shall be my breath; or the cool air fans your throbbing temple, it shall be my spirit passing by. Sarah, do not mourn me dead; think I am gone and wait for me, for we shall meet again. As for my little boys, they will grow as I have done, and never know a father's love and care. Little Willie is too young to remember me long, and my blue-eyed Edgar will keep my frolics with him among the dimmest memories of his childhood. Sarah, I have unlimited confidence in your maternal care and your development of their characters. Tell my two mothers his and hers I call God's blessing upon them. O Sarah, I wait for you there! Come to me, and lead thither my children. Sullivan"

What is the weirdest porn you‚Äôve ejaculated to? ,Glad no one knows I Reddit. It was a hentai video where this monster had an INCREDIBLY HUGE dick. Bout a foot and a half in width and maybe 10ft long. Picked the girl up with two fingers and put her on it missionary style. The bulge went a little over her head. Girl's boyfriend in the back begs the monster to stop but he keeps going and when he comes she ends up dying as her blood stains down his dick. After I nut I thought 'What the hell is wrong with me... This is so sick..' If we're talking people porn then I once nutted to a HotKinkyJo video. No description needed.

What times has your dad crying made you cry? ,"My dad is a super emotional guy in general, but like when I see him cry it‚Äôs characters dying in movies or TV shows. I mean, he didn‚Äôt even cry when he found out my mum had an affair, or when both his parents died, or when his best friend died. If he did, I didn‚Äôt see it BUT he cried pretty hard this Christmas with what I got him. So he has Carpal Tunnel syndrome, he can‚Äôt afford surgery because 1.) it‚Äôs too expensive and 2.) if he were to get it, he would be out of work too long and he can‚Äôt afford it. Anyways, he‚Äôs really into computers and playing with his Drone and you need to use a keyboard for both, obviously. When I went to his house, I noticed he had rolled up socks to put under his wrists so he‚Äôll be comfortable enough to use his laptop without his wrists hurting too much. I guess he didn‚Äôt last too long, even with all the medications he takes and the braces he wears. I can tell how much pain he‚Äôs in and it breaks my heart to see my dad like that. So, I went to Best Buy and got him this super cool keyboard that has this padding for your wrists. You can angle it anyway you need to for your hands and wrists to be as comfortable as possible. I figured, since I myself couldn‚Äôt afford the surgery, that this could be the next best thing. It was well worth how much it cost because when he opened it, he literally started bawling. He hugged me so hard and kissed my forehead. He picked me up that night from work and said he had set it up the moment he got home and started using it and although he still needs to take his medications, it‚Äôs not when using the keyboard. He said he was able to use it for hours without being in pain and having to get off because he ‚Äúadjusted it just the right way‚Äù. I was and still am so happy that they were HAPPY tears rather than anything sad. He still talks about it today. Also, I asked if he liked any of his other presents and I guess I was the only person who got him anything. Not even my own sister got him anything. I cried tears of joy for him for his reaction to that gift because it made him SO happy, but angry tears at my sister who doesn‚Äôt care about anyone but herself."
What times has your dad crying made you cry? ,"My dad was a really staunch, emotionless guy his whole life. I had never seen him cry once for the first fifteen years of my life. He let out a handful of tears on his deathbed and it really fucked me up for a while. Tbh I still cry when I think about it too hard"
What times has your dad crying made you cry? ,"We ( my husband and I) had been taking care of him on hospice for about 9 ish months. He was home from the hospital for the last time, he was in a ton of pain so he was very very drugged on morphine. We didn't know how long he'd last, ( couple hours or a couple days). I was making dinner for family that came to see him, and he's finally awake but still very out if it. I walk in his room with my grandma ( he was my grandpa but the only thing close to a dad I ever had) he looks at her and can't remember her name he doesn't know where he is, we re assure him. He looks at me and smiles the sweetest biggest smile I'd ever seen and says ""(my name)!!"" And tears start falling and he takes a breath, his last, still smiling and crying...... I have never been more happy or torn apart than at that time in my life so far. Happy he remembered me even in his daze, happy that it made him so happy, and so so fucking sad that it will be a he last thing I ever hear him say... I loved and love him so much. He only cried one other time in my presence, when I moved away for a year as a child to live with my mom and her terrible ex to see if that was a viable option. ( It was not, and he rescued me soon after)"

What is the ultimate ‚Äúpower move‚Äù? ,"It's how to describe, but it felt very much like a corporate takeover.

What is the ultimate ‚Äúpower move‚Äù? ,"She sat between her husband and the new boyfriend and acted like nothing was wrong.

Boyfriend knows your boss, Husband, and they are actually good friends. Should I put in a good word for you with [boss]?"" It was... amazing to see play out. The weird thing was her husband didn't even do anything shitty to her for her to pull this power move. They both agreed to the divorce and she just wanted to pull the move to be on top. I think she won the battle, but lost the war, since her family sided with husband in the divorce."
What is the ultimate ‚Äúpower move‚Äù? ,For me a fresh out of collage engineer (early 20s) where most of the people I have to talk to are in their mid-40s I get looked down on all the time for my age. So when someone comes in to the office nothing about my job is better then as I'm talking to them casually throwing my coat on my chair and sitting down at my desk as I watch them try to comprehend how someone so young has thier own desk.

When she came she didn't apologize or anything, but she was so lazy that when she gave us our check, she forgot to include like 75 of our meal so it was 12 bucks. I'd say worth it"

When do you know when it‚Äôs time to end a long term relationship? ,"When they want things you don't want or vise versa and compromising would lead to unhappiness for both parties. Mutually ended a long term relationship 3 months before the wedding. Best decision. We just wanted different things at different times and realized we just didn't work together. I eventually found someone that was at the same place as me, wanted the same stuff, and we are absolutely a team to this day (over 8 yrs together, 7 married). He also found the sweetest person and they are much better suited for each other. You need more than history with a person to make it work. You need understanding and compromise that each person is happy with. I would be happy working 2 jobs if it meant I didn't have to do household chores and still had a clean house. My husband would be fine with having a part time job and maintaining the house and kids if I cooked. We find a compromise and make it work."

"Current and former college students, when you were in college what was the reason you ""Ghosted"" your group project members? ","I ghosted a girl who was ghosting me for a group project and did the project by myself. I got so mf-ing ill mid-semester and then I was runnig against the deadline, stressed out, with the help of my boyfriend, to give this girls the points she needed... We made it, though (my boyfriend will start college this next semester... he learned a lot by himself to be able to help me). I learned my lesson and now I don't feel like working in a group, no matter what the teacher will think about me. I did my best to help the girl out, and never actually got as mad with her as I should have... But I can't keep stressing myself for dead weight in a project group."

We had a group project and given I was the only guy surrounded by 3 insanely hot Hispanics who actually attended the lectures when I skipped, 2 days prior to the due date, it was unfortunate news that one of teammates grandmother had passed. So she couldn't finish the project at least her part. And her friends, deeply saddened as well, were too down to finish their parts as well. Long story short, I carried the team without my beloved project members, got everyone an A, and was rewarded two weeks later by them. Got baited to their dorm for a ""thank you for saving our asses on the project"" . The gesture was nice and all but honestly it was worth it."

"Non Americans of reddit, why are you so jealous and envious of Americans? ","Not insanely taxed in Australia. I work a 38 hour week and am paid a little over $1,000 and pay $200 in tax, so bring home just over $800. Two years ago I had a major operation and a week recovering in hospital - I paid $0. As the operation was cancer related I need to have 6 monthly check ups with an oncologist which is not free but subsidised so I only pay $35.00 per visit. We are taxed a percentage of our wage once we earn over $350 per week ($18,200 per annum). If we earn less it‚Äôs in the ‚Äútax free threshold‚Äù. If your employer does deduct a small amount of tax from your $350 per week you will get it back at the end of the financial year after you‚Äôve filed a Tax Return.

So when ever someone tells me they would ‚Äúlove to be a vegetarian, except they love In n Out burgers, I ask them why they want to be a vegetarian, then I ask how often they eat In m Out. Then I say, why not give everything else up but In n Out. If their reasoning is climate, ethical or animal related, giving up some (when you are not ready to give up all) will STILL have a beneficial impact! If everyone gave up 1/2 of the animal products they consume, the world would instantly benefit, and fewer animals would suffer. Isn‚Äôt that a good thing too?"

My friends are all at the door and tell me to come outside. It's been a steady rainfall for about an hour and we just grab a bunch of small fireworks like sparklers and shit and just go running around the neighborhood howling, such a great time!"
What's your best new years story? ,"[Disclaimer; nothing happens in this story] One time I left my apartment for New Years and was walking around town. I ended up in a bar and sat down at a table no one was at near the window. Some time passes and a group of like 3-4 girls sits at the table diagonal to me, they were those small tables only meant for like 2 people to eat at. I could see them in my peripheral vision in front of me talking and doing whatever. Then after a bit they all turn and look at me. My gaze was locked on my drink this entire time though so I kept staring at it as if they weren't looking at me. Then just kept looking for at least another minute or two without talking or anything. Eventually they got up and left. No idea why they were grilling me... Maybe they wanted my table? It was half the size of the one they were at, though."

What lengths would you go to?? ,"Not a problem, I have gone through it twice. It's unpleasant to say the least. Luckily for myself I wasn't home for either of the events. The first time I was 15, just got a copy of wrestlemania on VHS from a friend who had recorded it. My dad, when my room got to a point of uncontrollable messiness, would throw everything in my room into a pile forcing me to tidy up. I hadn't paid any attention to the rest of the house and when he got home I got the blame for doing the same to every other room, they had been trashed, he thought it was some form of revenge, I guess, I wasn't fussed I just wanted to see stone cold wreck some folks. Took about 20mins of arguing before he noticed the back door had been knocked through with a sledge hammer ha"
What lengths would you go to?? ,"Similar to your story in that my car was nearly stolen but not a home break-in but I guess I'll share anyway! I worked at a group home for teenage boys who have various charges pending (usually weed/alcohol, occasionally assault or stealing their parent's car, sometimes more, sometimes less) but all of them had really rough home lives and for various reasons weren't allowed at home or in public school. There's an office where they make phone calls if they need/want them and a large closet off that where wallets and keys and such were kept. One of the boys demanded to stay in the office while his buddy was on the phone. They're supposed to have the phone on speaker so staff can make sure they're not talking about anything they're not supposed to but he refused. While guy 1 was on the phone distracting me, guy 2 was hovering around the door to the closet. The lock was broken from a previous attempt but for whatever reason management never had it fixed. He went in, grabbed my keys since they were in the first seen. Guy 1 hung up the phone and then they played monkey in the middle with me and the other staff (bc they were like 5'10 and 6'1 while I and the other staff are 5'4 and 5'5) until they pressed the fire alarm button that unlocks the main door. I went out the side door since I had a key and met them at my car. Guy 2 was a dick and wouldn't listen to me. My car is like 20 years old and the drivers side door hadnt worked as long as I've had it so while guy 2 was trying to unlock the driver's side door, I was telling guy 1 (bc he's a sweet heart that just goes along with others' stupid ideas) that I had medicine in my wallet and that I would unlock the vehicle for them if they'd just let me get my wallet and meds out. Guy 1 knew I lived around the mall in the city they were headed and said he'd leave the car there for me and make sure guy 2 didnt hurt it, he got the keys from guy 2 and gave them to me. I got the keys, got my wallet and while they were piling into the car, they didnt realize I still had the keys. I was backing up toward the building and by the time they realized I was leaving I was at the door. Guys 1 was out first and looked over at me (like 15 ft away) and I just gave him a pleading look and said ""really?"". He looks at guy 2, back at me, pauses long enough for me to shut the door (that locks immediately) and I heard guy 1 yell ""she took the keys, we gotta run!"" The police caught them like 3 days later (they were court-ordered to be at this home and we had to call when they run away). I was sad for guy 1 but would've pressed charges on guy 2 if I could've. Had they suggested violence for the keys I wouldn't have put up a fight since I have insurance and the work place has insurance to cover this type of thing but guy 1 was nice enough to alert guy 2 and let me get back inside. It was pretty pulse-pounding situation though, because I didn't know what was gonna happen at any moment through it."

What lengths would you go to?? ,"To be honest mate if they are after property... Let that shit go, hopefully it's insured. Lock yourself and family in a room or shout from upstairs that you are armed, have called the police and they can take anything they want from downstairs. It's for the best, don't be risking your life over a TV or some pointless shit. However, I live in a ranch style house, one storey, if intruders came near my wife or son I would defend them with my life however ineffectual that may be. I'm sorry your personal space and sense of security in your home was desecrated. Depending on your situation, secure your home to a higher standard/create a panic area you can barricade from intruders/finally, if your beliefs allow... Personal protection weapon to dissuade intruders from coming close to your family. I hope you find the level of security and comfort you had before your intrusion. Stay safe buddy!!"

What‚Äôs the best/worst/ most memorable New Years Eve experience you‚Äôve ever had? ,That‚Äôs incredible
What‚Äôs the best/worst/ most memorable New Years Eve experience you‚Äôve ever had? ,"Let me tell you about the time my friend hit a moving car with his face then committed identity theft and falsifying a police report. My friend,(we will call him Steve) and I were drunkenly walking home from a party about two miles away from my apartment. I had just met Steve a few days before so I didn't really know him all that well. So Steve is not the sharpest and most coordinated to begin with but give that man alcohol and it's a whole different ball game. Steve is doing the ol' drunken shuffle down the sidewalk but it had snowed earlier that night. It doesn't take long until Steve stumbles...right into the side of a bright yellow Hummer driving down the road. Now this is an important detail, so I will repeat it. The Hummer did not hit Steve. Steve hit the Hummer. He ricochets off and bounces merrily on down into the ditch while the Hummer slams on his brakes. I ask him if he's okay and he's like ""yeah, yeah, yeah...I'm fine. But watch this! Insurance money bro!"" The guy driving the Hummer comes rushing to help Steve who is now lying on the ground holding his leg, moaning and acting hurt, putting on an Oscar-worthy performance. The driver is absolutely freaking out, asking how he can help, hands in his hair, worried like hell he just really hurt this guy! I try to calm the driver down and tell him he's fine and that we will walk it off. He keeps asking and offering to call the cops and I'm trying to reassure this guy we are okay, Steve hit the car (not the other way around), and that we will be okay. I'm only 20, it's 1230-1am and I want nothing to do with the cops. I just want to go to bed. The driver being a responsible human being is still freaking out and is all ""are you sure are you sure?! I called an ambulance they will be here soon! Should I wait with you guys?!"" I finally get this guy calmed down enough to leave. Steve jumps out of the ditch like a damn gazelle and is like, ""Bro! I'm only 20, the cops can't come bro! We gotta go! We can't stay here!"" Now I'm starting to get mad and stressed out. I just wanted to be home and was trying to be responsible, putting myself within walking distance to avoid drama. We end up deciding to keep on walking towards the apt. About 5-10 min later, long enough to get some distance but short enough to still be on the same road, we see about five cop cars and ambulance flying down the street. I turn to Steve and say, ""that's for you man! They are looking for you."" Steve's eyes go wide and face goes pale when I tell him we need to call the cops so they don't think he is dead or something. We had 'pulled off' to grab a pack of smokes when that convoy rolls up onto the gas station. Steve is covered in mud, dirt, and other grime from having been rolling around in the ditch. It's pretty obvious that he's the guy they're looking for. They start asking us questions, why we left, ask for my ID, and I'm compliant acting as sober as possible since I'm only 20 myself. I'm happy when they tell me to get in the back of the cruiser to stay warm and they'll give us a ride home. Then I see them asking Steve a bunch of questions...more than it seems necessary to ask. Before I know it, they're asking me to get back out and corraborate his story. ""What is this guy's name? Is it Larry? Steve? How do you know him? Why are you guys out late and walking? Why does he keep telling us his name is Larry? He doesn't look like this guy...but everything matches."" I genuinely have no idea what's going on and that's what I tell them so after a few more minutes of this, it's back in the cruiser for me. Another 20 or so minutes pass and the cops relent, throwing Steve in the back and giving us a lift home. I thank the officers because it's cold, we are wet, and now it's probably 2-3 am and I just want to be done with it. Steve's too damn drunk to walk at this point but I am so pissed at him that I let him just push his dumb self up the stairs with the wall as support. As soon as we get inside, though, I ask for clarification. ""Bro! They gave me a 'drunken pedestrian on roadway' ticket!"" I tell him he's lucky. I thought that was the end of it until I get a message from his 'best friend' Larry a month or two later. He asked if I was with Steve on New Year's and if I knew anything about why he is getting a subpoena for a court date for being a drunken pedestrian on a roadway NYE in a city he wasn't even in (but I lived in). You see, Steve had taken a job a few weeks earlier as a mortgage loan processor or whatever and Larry was showing him the ropes. As such, he needed to know Larry's SSN to help him fill out and file paperwork or whatever. Being his 'best friend' he also knew his address and everything else about him. He had fed all of this info to the cops, who were thoroughly confused because every piece of info he gave them lined up...except the photo. Larry was brunette and Steve was blonde. They were similar in height, build, and facial structure apparently. And Larry was two years older...making Steve 22 and avoiding the drunken intox / underage charge (in his mind). I don't know what happened to them beyond that. I'm not a dramatic person to begin with and that was way too much for me. I believe he caught a bunch of other charges but eventually pled them down. I didn't talk to him much after that day haha"

"Can I hear some scary, TRUE horror stories that you guys have experienced? I always like hearing scary things that have happened in people's lives (I don't mean that in a creepy way, I'm just interested in scary stuff). It doesn't have to be paranormal, just a scary experience :) ","Even though this is my own post, I figured I'd get the ball rolling with my own scary experience. I've had a lot of scary things happen in my life, including seeing some sort of shadow in my basement (Which I may tell about later), but this experience takes the cake as it was very... *tangible*, I guess would be the world for it. This happened a couple months ago. I work at a reststop Papa Gino's/D'Angelo's along a turnpike, and because of that we have a lot of strange people coming through, a good portion of which don't speak english. When I first started working there a little over half a year ago, I was a bit shocked at some of our customers, but I got used to it after a while. A good thing to note in this story is that there was a gas station connected to a large food court which included the place I worked at, a Fresh City, McDonald's, and an Aunt Annie's. Aunt Annie's had large sitting area that was kind of sectioned off from the rest of the court. Aunt Annie's closes at around 8:30, and once their lights shut off, it gets completely deserted in that area. Back to my story, I was working a closing shift and my manager sent me on break around nine o'clock or so, so I clocked out and made myself a sandwich before taking of my uniform hat and putting on my Nascar sweatshirt. It wasn't my sweatshirt (It was my sister's boyfriend's, but he left it at our house a few years ago, so I just kind started wearing it and he let me keep it), so I didn't really know what the number stood for, all I really knew was that it had to do with Nascar. I didn't have a car to go sit in, but I prefer to sit away from people, so I sat in the most isolated part of the food court by Aunt Annie's. Bad decision on my part really, seeing as creeps pass through here daily and I'm a 17 y/o girl who barely makes it to being 5'1''. I began eating my sandwich and pulled out my phone to browse some memes to keep me occupied when I saw that an old man had sat just a few tables away from me. I looked over and noticed he was staring at me, which made me a bit nervous, but I chalked it off to him just seeing who he was sitting by. I went back to my own business, doing my best to pay attention to my surroundings. He was still staring. ""Hello,"" He said to me. I nearly jumped out of my skin as I turned to look at him and returned his hello. ""What's that number on your shirt for?"" I felt quite relieved and I realized he'd probably been trying to read my shirt, and that's why he was standing. ""It's a Nascar shirt, I think it's a car number."" I said. ""What was that? I can't hear you?"" He walked a bit closer and once again I felt nervous, but I repeated myself anyways. I probably should've left at that point to go sit closer to my work, but I figured I was just paranoid because I'm not really good at talking to people. ""I see. You're a very pretty young girl, you should let your hair down. You're lucky to be such a pretty young girl."" Now, I'm sure you guys probably know how nice old people loved to compliment kids, but this was not that kind of thing, not at all. He walked a bit closer as he spoke and he was a good five feet away from me. I felt alarm bells going off and then I knew I needed to get out of there. I did my best to play dumb and kept talking. As he listened, he stood in place and didn't move any closer. After a minute or so, I finished talking, and he actually walked away and sat a good distance away from me, seeming to go and mind his own business. I took this opportunity to quickly pack my stuff up. As soon I was done putting my stuff away, I turned to get up, only to notice he is standing right outside my booth table so I couldn't get out. In his hand, he had a lit cigarette despite being inside. I felt my heart beating out of my chest and I wanted to throw up. I was cornered and didn't know what to do. ""Y'know, you're *smoking hot*."" He repeated that over and over as he stood over me. I was absolutely terrified, but he backed off after I talked to him before, so I calmed myself best as I could and tried to talk again. ""O-oh... thank you."" My voice shook but he didn't seem to notice. It had no affect this time, he just continued to repeat how I was smoking hot, or that I had a smoking hot body. I looked around and there was no one anywhere near me, and I was terrified to yell for help, not knowing what he'd do to me if I did. What if he stabbed me if I cried out? Or covered my mouth and raped me? Maybe someone would come, but the damage would've been done. After a minute or so of looking around for any means of escape, I had an idea and I hoped to god it would work. ""H-hey, you left your lighter on the table."" I pointed to where he'd recently be sitting. No, there was no lighter, but I was hoping he didn't know that. He took the bait and turned around, moving a bit away from the table. I took that opportunity and booked it back to my workplace. My manager, though usually a total asshole, saw how pale I was, tears pouring down my face, asked me what was wrong. I explained the situation to him and he told me to go calm down in the office, and he went and talked to the state police who had just minutes before bought their food and sat down. I bawled in the office while I finished my food before my manager came back and explained that there'd been an old man trying to pick up young girls here for days, though luckily to now avail. The officers took him into custody and I chose not to speak up for myself or try to press charges. After the ordeal I was so tired and scared that I didn't want to deal with pressing charges, I just hoped that he got what he deserved. Needless to say, I no longer sit over there at night in fear of what happened and just ask if I can eat in the office, which my managers all let me, thankfully. This is one of those stories you hear about all the time, but I never thought it would happen to me. Be careful out there, everybody, not just girls. Creeps can target anyone, try not to be isolated in the dark."

"Why are people saying that Atheism is destroying America, when there are way bigger problems that must be dealt with? ","People remember when the US was more outwardly religious. This was in their childhood when they were typically unaware of the problems publicly discussed today. There is a natural desire to understand why things are the way they are. Either things have been like this all the time OR things have gotten worse. They find inconceivable to accept that they were unaware of how fucked up the world is so it MUST have changed The one, most noticeable change is the move away from organized religion. They fixate upon that as the single reason for our problems."
"Why are people saying that Atheism is destroying America, when there are way bigger problems that must be dealt with? ","Uhm, pretty sure that if you build your nation over the ""in god we trust"" motto, and people need to swear on the bible for a lot of formal stuff, people tend to believe that god is somewhat important for the state."
"Why are people saying that Atheism is destroying America, when there are way bigger problems that must be dealt with? ","99/100 of the people saying that are right wing religious nuts. I'm a Christian and I despise the people that claim that. If you are a conservative and a Christian you did something wrong. Jesus wants you to help people, not be happy you hurt them with ridiculous policies because you cant think for yourself. Then hold Fox news above the Bible because you dont like to read. Part of it is just the brainwashing from terrible and out of date education. The other is emotional retardation and fear of change"
"Why are people saying that Atheism is destroying America, when there are way bigger problems that must be dealt with? ",America is a business. Whether you like/acknowledge that or not. Sometimes power is based on fear. In this case fear of the unknown. No one knows what happens after death. Not a clue but people still fear it. ‚ÄúIn God we trust‚Äù is a phrase on all US Dollars not to show religion but to say that He is stronger than even the Almighty Dollar. I lost my train of thought.

"Experienced drinkers of Reddit, what advice do you have for the inexperienced? ","Eat first and if it's a long night, have something in between. Drink plenty of water especially before going to sleep. Take is slow and find your limit first with something that has a lower alcohol percentage and then slowly add stronger stuff. Never leave your drink unattended and keep an eye out even when the bartender is making it. Even with friends because you can't be 100% sure they kept an eye out on it while drunk. If you left your drink unattended, do NOT drink it. Any drink you set on fire, blow carefully and from an angle and not above so you don't end up setting yourself on fire."

He has revealed the systemic racism of income inequality and poverty was not an antiquated symptom of a bygone age, but a true expression of the views of many who grew up during a time when education was driven by religion and fear. He has also shown the world that there will come a time very soon when the younger generations will inherit its burning remains, and if they have time, have the skill and flexibility to reshape it with an eye on the past, knowing that our future depends on working together and fixing the failures of those who came before."

What is your craziest New Year story? ,"Got pulled over on my way home from work because the guy in front of me was drunk. Braked hard after pulling in the exit ramp, no reason. I had to brake. The car behind me was a cop. He was so dissappointed as he watched the car in front speed away. Let me go (I worked in a group home, no drinking for me). Said my air freshener tree was blocking my view. I said, ""No worries. I understand. The car in front of me braked, but you were behind me. I'd have pulled me over too with that perception."" We had a laugh. Almost missed the ball drop. Yeah, I know, boring. I typically worked New Year's, even when I was a kid. Luckily, the cops are fairly familiar with the group home workers. Being essential employees, we need their help when the roads are closed."

What movie made you ask what the hell you just watched? ,2 movies... Tusk and Silenced
What movie made you ask what the hell you just watched? ,I was going to say the same thing. It‚Äôs oddly a good movie though
What movie made you ask what the hell you just watched? ,"The 2012 Les Mis movie. It was kind of like witnessing a car crash before my very eyes. Now, don‚Äôt get me wrong, some of the scenes are good, but everything else was either okay, mediocre, or just bombastically bad. I mean Russell Crowe‚Äôs performance was just wow."
What movie made you ask what the hell you just watched? ,"I actually liked the fact that Luke was imperfect. We know that, despite being such a great protagonist, he grew up to be a flawed character. Honestly, he should have been flawed like that back in Episode IV, and only slightly better at it by the time we reach VIII."
What movie made you ask what the hell you just watched? ,"See, this is why I get frustrated when people yell at me for not knowing why it was bad. I'm like ""Why was it bad?"" followed by ""DUH! It was awful! How dense can you be that you don't know!?"" like it's some sort of dystopian Banana Sketch. Don't worry, somebody else already explained it for me. Plot-driven instead of character-driven."

What should you be afraid of when going under anaesthesia? ,"Nothing. I tell all my patients that they are statistically more likely to die on their way to the hospital than by anesthesia. Recall is also very very rare. If anything I‚Äôd say to prepare (not be afraid of) for pain. So many patients think surgery doesn‚Äôt hurt. I think the more realistic you can be about how much pain relief you will have is the best. We try to prevent it all, but most people WILL have pain afterwards. Prepare for it so it‚Äôs not a huge surprise. Also be afraid that your surgeon is an idiot. Many surgeons are idiots."

"Lonely fucking people of Reddit, what are you doing on New Years Eve? ","I cried. My boyfriend of 9 years, and the love of my life, left me in May 2018. I just can‚Äôt let go. I don‚Äôt want to and I feel like I‚Äôm not supposed to? I never got an explanation. And I have not had a single day since May 2018 where I didn‚Äôt cry in intervals throughout every single day. I miss him so much. I‚Äôm always sad wherever I go put because I just want him to be there with me. I wanted us to share our life together. I have no interest in other men even though other men have showed in interest in me. Christmas was... torture. without his stocking being there for the first time. Without him and I exchanging gifts with each other. I hate when I come home and then I‚Äôm alone for the rest of the night. He‚Äôs not beside me anymore, and he‚Äôs never going to come home to me from work ever again. God I just miss him being my right hand. My lover. My best friend. And he left me for someone else. A pain that is truly indescribable. Nothing hurts more than finding out you were unwanted because your partner was developing feelings for someone else. Just when I though it couldn‚Äôt get any worse, my very ill friend passed away the day after Christmas. I‚Äôve never had this happen before. I‚Äôve never had a close friend die. It feels so surreal, and it‚Äôs so fucked up. She deserved so much more than to pass away at 25 years old. It doesn‚Äôt feel real. I keep waiting as if going to get an update about her from the hospital. The reality of it is that she‚Äôs gone. Forever. I lost 2 important people to me. One of them being my favorite person in the world. How do you deal with a double heartbreak? I‚Äôm just sitting here crying on the first day or January because I feel so empty and alone."

What‚Äôs the worst your mental health has become and what was it like? ,"I feel like this is probably very common - feeling completely fucked up, trying to justify those feelings, and then still being disconnected from it all at the same time. I don't think you're going to like my answer to this though. You need to find a way to say this out loud to someone. I can't tell you who that person should be - you know best. But really, this isn't something you should keep to yourself. Confiding in someone is kind of a two way street - it takes a lot of honesty on both ends. And I think you'll be surprised by just how open and receptive some people around you might be if you let them in."
What‚Äôs the worst your mental health has become and what was it like? ,"Basically I‚Äôll read things with rape it on purpose. I‚Äôll search up stories and force myself to read it. I‚Äôll watch movies or shows with such scenes on purpose, etc. I feel that I deserve to suffer and I have ptsd for no reason and I‚Äôm lying to myself. So it‚Äôs lead to this habit. I would like to stop myself from doing it but I don‚Äôt know how to. I refuse to believe the incident that caused me to develop ptsd happen and for that I feel I need to suffer because other people have actually been through such situations and here I am fake suffering. I don‚Äôt who I am. I know but I just don‚Äôt feel connected to myself. I just try to think and I‚Äôll end up very confused. I‚Äôll try to talk someone and lose my train of thought almost instantly. I constantly think about suicide and I try to be open but my mind tells me not to. I also live in constant flashbacks."
What‚Äôs the worst your mental health has become and what was it like? ,"This last bout, at the worst of it, I spent an entire day trying to figure out how to tie a chain around my body and weight it down do I could surreptitiously hop overboard from a cruise ship so I wouldn't leave behind a body to have to dispose of, and make it look like an accident so I could leave behind life insurance money. I'd worked out all the tie points, and figured up how much chain and weight I needed, but then I got a call from my mom, and I realized that I'd rather be in pain than make others suffer, so I abandoned my plans."
What‚Äôs the worst your mental health has become and what was it like? ,"I blacked out and almost killed my oldest daughter. I came to when she gasped for breath and I was horrified. I did not know what had happened or what I had done. That was almost 20 years ago. I have since gotten help and am doing much better but I gave up my children willing right after it happened because I was afraid it would happen again, and they do not deserve that. I am still afraid to this day that it will happen again. Loosing your mind like that and having no clue what you have done is one of the worst things I have ever experienced. All because I had untreated anxiety and agoraphobia. The built up stress from it literally fried my brain and caused the blackout."
What‚Äôs the worst your mental health has become and what was it like? ,"I quit my job almost a year ago. I was pretty much working myself to death at that point. I almost never slept. Everything revolved around productivity for the company. I saw that the company was taking advantage of the team. Something really went wrong there, and I did what I could to legally stand up for all of us. But it didn't really matter in the end. Nothing really came of it. Some changes were made, but it never came close to what was actually needed. And it still fucking haunts me. You know, I tried to give myself a time out. It's been about a year and I still think about it. I still think about everyone else working for that company, and how they might get fucked over. And I can't fix it. I think this is probably something very bad for my mental health."

What was your most memorable dream? ,"I once had a nightmare about the devil. I was running down these metal stairs into a subway but reality shifted and there were two tunnels, one was lit with a red glare and the other pitch black. In the middle of the tunnels was this large outline of Satan, I couldn't see his face but I saw his gigantic hoofs and even seen the glistening of blood on the tuffs of fur. When he turned to leave down the red tunnel, I heard a loud screech and then fainted in the dream while reaching out towards him, the next thing I woke up in a subway with strangers around me. I dont remember much of that but I woke up in cold sweat after that. Another dream I had was when my family were all hanging out in my parents room, someone said ""What's wrong with(My dogs name)?"" Then their faces twisted into horror, simmilar to that painting 'The Anguished Man', when they scream this high pitched whirring sound, my dog started to bleed from his stomach. I woke up with my ears ringing. I still dont like the sight of broken gifs because it reminds me of that feeling. I've had so many trippy dreams but those two always make me queazy."
What was your most memorable dream? ,"When I was a kid, I had this strange dream (nightmare at the time) of a man approaching me and using his hands to split his skull open down the middle and show me his brain. Terrifying at the time and don't remember anything else about the context."

A hippo caught me, and bit my legs off in a single bite - I felt my life draining from me and everything fade to black - then I woke up in a sweat... It felt very very real... Roughly 35 years have passed and I still remember having that dream! :-/"
What was your most memorable dream? ,"I've had a recurring dream for years now....I'm at the top of a cliff overlooking a barren desert. There is a girl yelling for help below me.

My dream was I found a little puppy on a dirt road and really wanted to keep it, but something was telling me I couldn't. All of a sudden a school bus pulls up and I get on. Looking out the window, crying, leaving the little puppy behind. I started hearing music coming from the front of the bus and it was CCRs "" who will stop the rain"" playing. I turned again in my seat and looked out the window again and a car pulls up beside the bus. I look down and see the cutest little boy holding that puppy in his lap. He gave me a smile and nodded, as if to tell me the puppy will be alright. I apparently had a backpack with me, pulled out a a sheet of paper and scribbled ""Thank you"" and pressed it up against the window. The car drove off, and I woke up with tears just streaming down my face. I'll never forget that dream. And for some reason, I found a little peace thinking my sister is ok."

We didn't even have a give-a-penny dish to pull from, so I just underpaid.

Could it be that what we once thought of as ""relationship"" is actually changing? With 8 billion people on the planet, the old model which is centered around producing children does seem outdated and maybe even negligent.

What was the most awkward moment of your life? ,"I saw my aunts mother in-law and father in-law at a gas station. He was pumping gas and she was reading a book in the truck. They are good about joking around so I thought it would be funny to sneak up to her window and bang on it to startle her. As I‚Äôm sneaking up he looks a bit puzzled but whatever I gobble him the finger to the lips universal shh sign and he looks very puzzled. She apparently sees his reaction before I reach the truck(luckily). She turns around and it‚Äôs not her! I was horrified. I apologized and looked up at him, it‚Äôs not him! It was a similar looking overweight bald guy driving a similar looking truck with a wife that at least from behind had the same hair."

What is your go-to 3am snack food? ,Yeah that was a really weird way to respond.
What is your go-to 3am snack food? ,"Personally, I am quite fond of the traditional English meal: fish and chips. This can be a bit challenging to create when in a 3 AM sleep stupor, so there's no shame in staging it. Simply crunch up your Doritos and mix it in with the canned tuna.

[Serious] Who is the unluckiest/luckiest person of all time? ,"I nominate Anne Bonny. She was born into a reasonably wealthy family. Thats basically being lucky from the start. She had a husband eventually who provided a good home for her. Even luckier. But she grew bored of him. Not to worry though because here comes the luck train (choo choo). She meets the captain of a pirate ship who happens to fancy her. Luck. The pirate captain takes her onto his ship despite sailors at the time seriously getting the heebie jeebies around girl sailors (bad luck n all that). Thats lucky. The pirate she joined was a reasonably successful one. Also lucky considering many many many men died being pirates. When she was found to he female her crew chose to value her fierce combat over the whole bad luck thing. When her ship was captured she was meant to be hung as a pirate. But wait! Her father somehow forgives her, bails her out, and she lives a long probably nice life until she dies. In summary, she had a good and stable life from birth. She had a man to take care of her (which back in the day was a very good thing indeed). She got to live a life of adventure. And then when it came time to pay the piper for said adventure, her dad bailed her out and she lived a good life after. Luckiest. Person. Ever."

What was the strangest thing you ever overheard? ,"Heard this WAY back in the day, I was in 6 grade or something. It was lunch time, had gotten my food and just with some random people. Started chowing down when I overheard the person a little to my left and across from me trying to get the person in front of him attention. He then proceeds to inform this guy that his lips look just like his dick hole. Weirdest fuckin thing ever. There was no conversation before or after and I'm sure they didnt know each other."
What was the strangest thing you ever overheard? ,"""God dammit, you're constipated! Why can't you just accept it?!"" Was exclaimed in genuine exasperation by a man outside, walking passed my apartment. From what I could see through the bushes, he wasn't alone."
What was the strangest thing you ever overheard? ,"Me sitting behind 2 girls in my high school AP Chemistry class: &amp;#x200B; Girl1: I love bodysuits, they make my boobs look huge! (pushes out her chest and jiggles them a bit) &amp;#x200B; Girl2: I don't own any. Mine aren't that big anyway. &amp;#x200B; (they both look at me) &amp;#x200B; Girl1: Don't tell anyone we just said that. &amp;#x200B; Me: Your secret is safe with me. &amp;#x200B; Needless to say, it was fun semester."
What was the strangest thing you ever overheard? ,‚ÄúI have no dick! I. HAVE. NO. DICK.‚Äù -man running past my apartment at 2 in the morning.

What's the worst argument you've ever heard ? ,"My college roommate and I argued over how many holes a woman has down there. According to her, women have two. One for poo and one to pee and push babies out of. She‚Äôs now a nurse and hopefully has learned a little more about basic human anatomy. Can only imagine what her reaction was the first time she had to insert a urinary catheter!"
What's the worst argument you've ever heard ? ,I remember one time a person was saying a human embryo isn‚Äôt a human being. They were of course arguing prochoice but to say that a human embryo isn‚Äôt scientifically a human being is just factually incorrect. I was saying a baby at any stage in the womb is a human being. They said ‚Äúwell a fetus by definition is a human being at 8 weeks so before that it‚Äôs not a human being.‚Äù I couldn‚Äôt believe how stupid that was. The fetal stage begins at 8 weeks. It‚Äôs no different than like when we say toddler vs baby it‚Äôs just describing a different stage. One can be prochoice and not dumb but that was just a really stupid thing to say.
What's the worst argument you've ever heard ? ,Two girls arguing outside a tanning salon over which twit was darkest. They were both like 2 Irish lassies on a beach so I was hoping it would come to blows.

Why are people trying to force diversity onto Hollywood but not the NBA? ,"People don‚Äôt understand, I don‚Äôt want the NBA to be more diverse, the most skilled people should be there, just like Hollywood"
Why are people trying to force diversity onto Hollywood but not the NBA? ,Why was Achilles and Zeus cast as black people in the new show Troy?
Why are people trying to force diversity onto Hollywood but not the NBA? ,"I think a lot of people don't see acting as a difficult skill, something you have to practice, but rather as something that you are either good at or not. I'm not going to sit here and say that Caucasian people are genetically pre-disposed to being better at acting, but that social circumstances do help. English is the largest cinema market and since most countries that speak English as a first language are predominantly white, there are going to be more white actors and actresses. You aren't going to get a lot of professional acting coming out of low-income areas because pressure to have a stable income is higher because you can't necessarily move back in with mom and dad when you don't get a decent acting job for months. and because low-income areas tend to be populated by minorities it's another hurdle to making that difference. In comparison with NBA, you have to be good as basketball, But you also have to graduate high school and then go to college, NBA won't sign you until you have one year of university or college under your belt. To play on sports teams you generally need to maintain a minimum GPA, and unless you're good enough to be drafted after your first year, you need to continue doing that, so by perusing basketball (or other sports) you also get additional education that will help you with or without that pro contract. So there really isn't much risk to it."
Why are people trying to force diversity onto Hollywood but not the NBA? ,I know it does but what point were you trying to make? Are you saying that acting is or is not skill-based like basketball is?
Why are people trying to force diversity onto Hollywood but not the NBA? ,Conservatives don't have the ability to be intellectually honest.

What's the best way to mess with spam callers? ,"I worked for a telemarketer for a month in college (I know I know) It's honestly a pretty terrible job, and not one that anyone wants to do. It's a job that people take out of desperation, because they need to. I remember my very first day, a girl quitting and running out in tears because someone said something so vile to her. If you act like an asshole to these people, all that you're doing is making someone who already feels like shit, feel even worse. If you don't want them to call there are 2 pieces of advice I can give . Say ""please take me off of your list"", then they legally can't call you again (this obviously only applies to legal telemarketing operations). The second one is to never sign up for those ""win a free car!"" things at the mall, airshows, trade shows, etc. That's where they get your number for in the first place."

"Reddit, what are some New Years Resolutions you have actually followed through with and how did it change you? ","I cut out caffeine completely, cold-turkey, on New Year‚Äôs Day five or six years ago. I used to start with a large iced coffee every morning, then I‚Äôd get another one mid-afternoon. On days off, I‚Äôd drink coffee all day long. One day, my coffeemaker (the kind with pods) refused to brew, and I actually had a crying fit in my kitchen. I was a legit coffee addict. I had terrible headaches for a month when I was weaning my body off of the caffeine. When the headaches subsided, I realized I that felt so much better, and my anxiety had gone from a 10/10 to a 1 or 2/10. I did miss the taste of coffee (herbal tea doesn‚Äôt taste as good), so after that tough month, I started letting myself have one iced decaf per day. There‚Äôs a very small amount of caffeine in decaf, but it doesn‚Äôt impact my anxiety at all. It‚Äôs been years now, and I‚Äôm so glad I stuck with my resolution!"

If you‚Äôre introducing two people when there‚Äôs a significant difference in age or position, it‚Äôs polite to introduce the younger or lower-ranking person to the older or higher-ranking person first. Something like, ‚ÄúMom, this is my friend Anna from school. We‚Äôre on the track team together. Anna, this is my mom, Mrs. Smith (or Kathy, or whatever she wants your friends to call her)‚Äù. Same goes with introducing lower-ranking colleagues to a higher-up manager."

In academic circles, you defer to those with the highest degrees. In professional circles, you defer to those with the most talent or skills.

Who is the coolest stranger you‚Äôve met that you never saw again after? ,Ewwwwwwwwwwwwwwweee
Who is the coolest stranger you‚Äôve met that you never saw again after? ,"I travel a lot for work so a lot of really cool interactions on planes. One guy was a business whiz and gave me tons of great advice and encouragement for growing my side business. As we deplaned in our city the flight crew was all saying bye to him. He turned out to be a big wig on Alaska Airlines but was flying back in coach where I was. He‚Äôd given me his email address and has sent me a few resources for business stuff. Such a generous and kind person. Another guy owns a small competitor (not really, I guess - in different markets) to Comcast, a business he grew from scratch. Another really generous person through sharing life stories and general insights and being genuinely interested in my life. He was such a cool guy, I could have talked with him for hours but we parted ways when our plane landed in Portland. This one lady started a super cool school curriculum in a very small district north of my city to teach kids social skills, confidence, communication, empathy, etc. She‚Äôd turned a lot of young lives around through her work. One time I sat next to a guy who had previously worked in the water department for a small Pacific island territory. He and his wife raised their small children there and had countless adventures, and this was after they‚Äôd done Peace Corps in Thailand (pre kids). Last month I met this incredible guy from New York City who‚Äôs an owner of several businesses, including a chain of super crappy restaurants in my city and elsewhere. This guy was a master of knowing exactly what this restaurant chain is all about, who goes there, why, etc. He‚Äôd never even eaten in one of the restaurants, but he knew every aspect of the business, even the employee experience and kitchen stuff. This was one of many businesses he owned. And again, amazingly inspiring, passionate, encouraging, and fun to listen to. I meet the coolest people on planes. It‚Äôd be impossible to pick just one ‚Äúthe coolest.‚Äù"

She said, ""don't ruin it."" And walked out of my life. I feel like I was an extra in a scene."
Who is the coolest stranger you‚Äôve met that you never saw again after? ,"One time I was riding the metro and I didn't pay and the police made a surprise visiting and we're looking for proof of payment.

What is your most akward poop story? ,"I was but a young lad, 18 or so. Was working as a cashier at the anus of Canadian grocers ‚Äì Food Basics. It makes No Frills look like Real Canadian Superstore, amirite!? ANYWHO! I had some stomach‚Ä¶ issues‚Ä¶ at the time and the result was a shitload of diarrhea. \*stares blankly, awaiting raucous laughter\* We didn‚Äôt get much in the way of breaks (maybe 10 minutes on a five hour shift) and we had to wait for someone to come relieve us. I swear I‚Äôm not making these puns on purpose. At any rate, I started feeling that trademark rumbly in my tumbly and knew I had to go. I put my little ‚Äòthis lane closed‚Äô sign up, scanned the FUCK out of what was left on the belt, and bid my customers a lovely day. NOW, obviously I‚Äôm not going to go to the back and use the store washroom‚Ä¶. a) There were always porn magazines in there for some reason, and that made me feel different down there. b) As a shy, awkward loser I wasn‚Äôt about to become the ‚Äòsmelly explosive diarrhea guy‚Äô at work. So I bolted into the disgusting mall to use that washroom. I had never used the public washroom in this mall before and was elated to see it had a locking door. ‚ÄúThe whole washroom to myself. Thank fucking god.‚Äù I locked up, got into the stall, locked that too, then just gave it all I had. I painted that bowl. It was boiling hot and my bottom was screaming. I honestly thought I heard a faint ‚Äòhelp me‚Äô at one point. The liquid feces was everywhere. In the bowl, on the bowl‚Ä¶ it had come out with such ferocity that the splatter covered my ass completely. So I wiped and patted and wiped some more. I waddled over to the sink (locked door, remember?), wet some tp, and wiped and patted some more. Eventually, when I was dry enough and clean enough and there was little risk of further fecaling, I re-pantsed and washed my hands. Not the main focus of the story, but at this point I was really grossed out to see that the hand-drying option in this particular restroom was a cloth towel in a paper towel type dispenser, on a spool. So I‚Äôm basically left to try my hands on some gross rag that some other filthy pig rubbed his or her grubby paws on. But I digress. I gave myself a quick ‚ÄòYou did it, buddy‚Äô in the mirror, unlocked the door, and made my triumphant exit. Right into a line of seven adults ‚Äì men and women alike ‚Äì waiting to use the only washroom in the mall, as I had locked the door. I soon realized the following‚Ä¶ a) I should have just locked the stall door and hoped no one else came in while I was spraying. b) I was in my Food Basics uniform, so everyone there would recognize me and most likely be served by me at the grocery store later that day and ever after. c) I decided that day that because of the amount of disgusting shit and the sheer volume of toilet paper that accompanied it, I shouldn‚Äôt flush. TL;DR I hijacked the public mall washroom to have explosive diarrhea, didn‚Äôt flush the toilet, walked out twenty minutes later in my work uniform to see a lineup of people as I‚Äôd locked myself in."

"What does ""married, but withhold at single rate"" means? ",You should probably go to r/personalfinance
"What does ""married, but withhold at single rate"" means? ","In the US Tax System, you generally complete a Form W-4 with your employer, telling your Payroll Dept. how you would like taxes withheld from your pay. The first step is requesting the Tax Table you would like to be taxed on: the Filing as Single Table, or the Filing as Married Table. The Married Table withholds at a lower rate (meaning that fewer taxes are withheld). However, a person who is married can basically request that their taxes be withheld at the higher Single rate, so that more money is withheld from your check (hopefully meaning that you will owe less, or receive a refund, when you file your federal income taxes). Basically, it‚Äôs an option to say: yes, I am married, but I want to be taxed as if I was single. I hope that helps!"

"Bartneders of reddit, What are some great cocktails to get my wife who hates alcohol into drinking? ","If your wife hates alcohol, I would suggest not pushing too hard on trying to get her into drinking. If she truly hates alcohol, a virgin daiquiri might be a good place to start, it's basically just a fruit smoothie. If she just hasn't found alcohol that yet agrees with her, a classic daiquiri could be a good starting place. 2 parts white rum, 1 part fresh lime juice, 1/2 part simple syrup (equal parts water and sugar). I know you didn't go into to detail about why she hates alcohol, but if she tells you she doesn't want to drink it, don't force her. In bars where I've worked, the people always having the worst time were the people who didn't want to be drinking in the first place."

"Redditors who have ongoing feuds with someone, tell us about what a jerk they are and how they wronged you? ","He sounds like... Just the worst. Sorry you had that experience pal, I've had a really shitty boss before lol it sucks"
"Redditors who have ongoing feuds with someone, tell us about what a jerk they are and how they wronged you? ","The last place I worked was a new restaurant opening. Vegan place and I bought in as the boom is happening and I have nothing against vegans, except.... Once we actually got going, I realized the food was objectively awful. From Yelp: "" This is probably my least favorite place ever. ""; "" but when you're in an area that has: Nami, Green, The Coronado, and Urban Beans... not to mention places with a variety of Vegan Options: Pizza Heaven Bistro, Pita Jungle.. etc.. I don't see a reason to try \*\*\*""; "" The prices were extremely high and the quality and flavor of the food was not good. Maybe someone who doesn't have taste buds would like coming here because the food is very bland and has odd flavors. "" So obviously, as a sous chef, I feel like I should tell him. Not only does he double down, but he starts also running shitty specials and adding menu items that are just as bad or worse. Meanwhile, he has another location that he said was staying open, but then said the staff would decide on their own if they could maintain it and keep it running, then said within a month that he'd shut it down and only keep our inner city location. So, not only does he not understand flavors, how to generally cook (didn't know you had to mark the center of a peanut butter cookie because it's dense and it helps it cook, basic fundamentals like that), or pricing, but he's extremely flaky and he's starting to rub me the wrong way. As I'm telling him things that need to be fixed, he just keeps doing more, eventually filling our front counter with 10-15 different baked goods daily. I'm now working 55-60 hours a week and he tells me he doesn't pay overtime. I've also been expected to provide my own pans, knives, towels on occasion, I let him use and eventually break a juicer that was just supposed to be for a day or two while he got a replacement for one that supposedly got lost in the mail oss.... So much stuff... Obviously I'm not gonna keep doing this. After 2 months, I realize this shit show is going nowhere and quit, and if you thought it was bad before, well here we go! He asked why I'm leaving, I reiterated all of my previous points. He sees that's no reason to leave and I say his inability to change IS and he's dumping people who live in a rural area into unemployment and he isn't even letting them know, a shitty move by anyone's standards. Then, after telling him that I was doing the work of an executive chef and not even getting paid like a sous chef and that his restaurant is not a restaurant but a bakery with bad food to offer, he stopped speaking to me completely. I get text after text from employees who can't BELIEVE I would leave them stranded and dump all of my workload on others. I try to talk them down, but they're not too receptive, so ignore, easy-peasy. He calls my new job to try to give them a reference that they didn't ask for and they had already hired me, because apparently he thinks stalking my facebook and my new job is a good look. I ask his accountant for check stubs to find out that my last paycheck was docked down to minimum wage AND he cut at least a day off, maybe more. On top of that, he has yet to give me my check and I have a wage dispute ongoing that he's probably going to try to claim that I only make minimum wage and worked something like 12-15 hours less than I did in the last pay period. So now I'm racking up some credit debt, waiting for a first paycheck from my new job (which takes an extra long time) and my last paycheck from my last job, which let's be clear, cooking and being a chef and all of this pays next to nothing already. Yeah, so, that fuckin' guy, amirite?"

My grandfather is my only living grandparent and is now quite old and feeble. I've not seen him since 2000 which was my fathers funeral. Doing the math now I can't believe it's nearly 20 years. The rest of the family that I grew up with-- The people who knew me from birth and I considered a major part of me now keep my grandfather heavily guarded and away from those of they've succeeded in alienating by way of fabricating stories for nothing more than monetary gain. I know that eventually I'll hear of his death and never see him again.

Alex brought home a girl and the parents did not approve of her at first it sounded like. Then I guess she eventually grew on them to the point of inviting her for a vacation. Alex found out she was cheating and broke up with her. Chris didn‚Äôt like this. One day they are at a friends house having a party. Alex and Chris were outside got into an argument about the girlfriend and it ended with Chris throwing a chair at Alex which hit him in the face. His own son. The family friend was telling us this story and showed a picture which showed a nasty bruise under his eye. My stepdad was shocked at that. He legitimately could not believe his best friend would do this. Chris is a calm person. You wouldn‚Äôt think he would lose his temper like that but he did. My stepdad wisely said nothing to him when we visited them later that same day.

"Fast food workers of Reddit, what has been your worst experience with a customer to date? ","Not a worst, but this girl tried to claim she was homeless in order to get the food we were going to waste (it was a couple minutes before closing), even though she was in a car full of friends and wearing nicer clothes than I own. Asking for free food is an annoying par for the course, but (poorly) using homelessness as a way to try and get free food you don't need? Homelessness is serious shit, the fuck's wrong with you?"

"Hey Reddit, what‚Äôs the most important thing you learned once you moved out on your own? ",Yep that one definitely came from experience unfortunately. The only thing that saved me was that I was on my phone when it happened so I could call that nice neighbor who let me crash on his couch that night and lent me clothes to go out the next day.

In 9th grade, I got my first crush, someone who I used to hate, but I fell in love with after he kept teasing me (because he liked me).

I also miss my sophomore and junior year, when I used to be a good runner before my hamstring injury screwed things up. Those were good times. I miss the cross country races, the anticipation of the race, which I thought I would never miss. I miss the indoor and outdoor track meets. I miss the first time I began to be a varsity runner (girls team), and the summer right before tenth grade, when I ran with the guys team and had some of the best runs of my life. At the moment though, I was often exhausted, but I improved alot on those runs."

"Men who've gotten a vasectomy, Do you regret it and how did it change your sex life? ",Right after that is when I realized the huge mistake I made. Sex became pointless without the main ingredient!! Got reversed a year and a half later and Swimmers are back in full force ;)
"Men who've gotten a vasectomy, Do you regret it and how did it change your sex life? ",Had my vasovasostomy (reversal) only a year and a half later .

Best decision ever to get reversed! Sex drive went thru the roof again ..still don't want kids - using other options

"What is something that people think is true, but is wrong? ","Companies are legally obligated to maximize their share price. They are only required to act in the interests of the business, and are given wide latitude in what that means -- basically if it's reasonably plausible, it's not illegal. If the shareholders are unhappy with how the company is being run, the remedy is to replace the management. It was a paper in the late 70s that argued that maximizing share price was 'best'. Prior to that, it was assumed that corporations had equal responsibility to their shareholders, their employees, and the community. But it just happened (pure coincidence I'm sure) to also justify skyrocketing executive compensation and got repeated over and over, people think it's the law."
"What is something that people think is true, but is wrong? ",reeeeeeeeeee1
"What is something that people think is true, but is wrong? ",DANGIT. NOT AGAIN
"What is something that people think is true, but is wrong? ","That your opinion is protected by whatever free speech laws there are. You are, of course, free to have and voice an opinion; however there may be legal, personal or other repercussions to deal with as a result of doing so. Experiencing negative repercussions are where people usually start yelling about ""free speech""... Welp, they were free to say what they did, but that freedom does not cover freedom from experiencing consequences."
"What is something that people think is true, but is wrong? ","Blue was traditionally a girl's colour and pink was for boys. Hitler then started to identify and ship off gay men to concentration camps. Those that were considered curable had pink triangles sewn onto their clothes to differentiate them from Jews, who had yellow stars. It was a way to classify inmates. Gay men were seen as effeminate and feminine, so the colour came to symbolise femininity in a disparaging way, and it stuck."

I needed a friend and i missed her but i made a mistake I should of never tried to get her back into my life. The first day i did she pretty much confirmed it was because of her it happens. I was in denial i dont want to believe someonee that meant so much to me and that i loved and cared for so much wants me to kill myself. I dont know i still kinda am in denial love blinds but hey i just dont know. I really hope thats not the case. I am in the worst spot possible and she doesnt care at all. I was there when she was crazy and i did the most to show her i cared, like she told me whe wanted. She said she was in the streets to see who cares for her. I did and i know im an idiot but i still do my heart doesnt want to believe she hates me. But my mind knows... I feel betrayed. So betrayed and hurt. Thought we had a special connection with eachother. But she played me. So im hoping it will end and end well But most likely just end up offing myself when too much stress. Anyway ill do anything to go back to normal."

What was your first ever day with the Internet like? ,"My first intro to the internet was on Compuserve sometime in the 80s. That was more of a MS-DOS interface and you just clicked into text screens of forums and stuff like that. It was super cool but didn't wow me as much as later, when my brother-in-law had a friend who was a big geek and he let me play around on it at his house. I spent hours that first night chatting with random people. It was exhilarating. That apparently encouraged my Mom to get my a computer and she got a Mac Performa bundle at Sears that came with eWorld, which was Apple's answer to AOL at the time. That ended up costing too much as it was a long-distance call, so we switched to something through the phone company and I ended up in Yahoo chatrooms, then AOL Instant Messenger which anyone was able to use, and then in college that died off and I got into sites like Fark, Digg, and then Reddit came along years later."

How do you fix a fucked up sleeping schedule? ,Go to one of those sensory deprivation pods. It helped me recalibrate after two transpacific flights.
How do you fix a fucked up sleeping schedule? ,"It‚Äôll take you about two weeks but if you‚Äôre consistent at when you go to sleep and get the right amount of sleep each night you should be good. There was a study published a few years back that goes into detail regarding how irregular sleeping patterns affect how long it takes to get back to ‚Äònormal‚Äô sleeping schedule. Keep in mind the longer you fuck up your sleeping patterns the longer it will take to recover back, hence the two week estimate."
How do you fix a fucked up sleeping schedule? ,"Depends on how bad it is. If you‚Äôre just a few hours off you can just stay awake until your normal bedtime by drinking caffeine or doing something exciting like playing a good game or going out with friends. I work nights so when my schedule gets completely flipped, on vacation for example, I do slow, boring things like reading or watching documentaries mid day so I can fall asleep for maybe 2 hours. The extra rest will help push your bed time back a good 6-10 hours."
How do you fix a fucked up sleeping schedule? ,"Make your sleeping space as dark and quiet as you can during the time you want to be asleep, and minimize potentials for disruption (turn phone off, let roommates know you are trying to get back on normal schedule, etc.). Warm herbal tea, a warm bath or shower, and reading before bedtime are all good ways to help your body transition into a resting state. To wake up, expose yourself to light and movement. Your body will want to be on a normal schedule, so if you give it decent conditions, it will get there. Good luck."

"Babyboomers, in 2050 what will the next generation miss the most about your generation that they take for granted? ","I'm not a Boomer, but I really can't think of anything that the Boomers bring to the table that doesn't ultimately hurt Gen X and Y. Their environmental policies have totally fucked us, they keep buying up cheap housing to rent out to younger generations as opposed to letting us buy entry level homes, thus inflating the housing market, their Social Security withdrawals slowly suck more and more money out of younger generations' pockets as more and more of them retire, AND, on a completely anecdotal level, the vast majority of them such at tipping. They are entitled, pampered, and do way more harm than good to future generations, IMO"

They had the chance to create systematic change to avoid environmental catastrophe and all they cared about is cheap gas and owning more shit. They now have inadequate savings and will far outlive their money. They will bankrupt our nation on the backs of younger generations and don't care one bit. By 2050 the rest of us will be incredibly relieved to be rid of the burden they will create in the next few decades. Disclaimer: I know not all boomers fit this description, but enough do that the point stands."

[SERIOUS] How long would it actually take to build a solid concrete wall along the US/Mexican border? ,Technically speaking that would depend on a number of factors so there‚Äôs no direct answer I can give. How thick does the wall need to be? How tall? How strong is the reinforcement? What grade of concrete do you want to use? How many labourers are you hiring? Do they get O.T? What and how much operating equipment are you sourcing? Is the land prepped or does it still need to be prepared? Not to mention the other engineering obstacles you would face constructing a wall that runs over different elevations and types of terrain.

Why do men eat faster than women? ,You should meet my mom

"When is a time, you or someone you know, has gotten themselves into a situation where you could almost hear the Curb Your Enthusiasm music playing in the background? ","I picked up my friend who was on probation to take him to his meeting where he suspected he‚Äôd be drug tested. Well he‚Äôd smoked some pot the day before and needed some way to have it not show up. When I arrived at his sister‚Äôs house to pick him up, he was standing outside vomiting. He gets in the car and I'm immediately struck with the smell of chlorine. He proceeds to tell me, that fearing the impending drug test, he‚Äôd drank a cup of bleach and a cup of vinegar. His tongue was completely white, he was throwing up into a bag the whole way there. I insist on taking him to the hospital but he refuses, telling me if he misses his appointment he will go to jail. I tell him whether or not he passes the drug test they are going to know he took something because his breath smelled like bleach and his tongue is white. But he has a plan for that as well. We get to the probation building and he pops in a piece of chewing gum and goes inside. He comes back a couple minutes later and tells me he mixed up his dates and that he didn‚Äôt have a meeting that day. He then decided he wanted to go to the hospital because he was afraid of dying. They pump his stomach. They tried to hold him there to evaluate him for attempted suicide but he convinces them that he wasn‚Äôt trying to kill himself but only after telling them the real reason why he drank the bleach. They get pretty upset about it and wind up calling his probation officer, and after he recovers he is arrested for a drug violation."

Well, I have ignored my mother, and father both, but my son is still battling for his life. I can't just ignore him. This is been a crazy hard year for me. No parent wants to hear that one of their kids has cancer. And I sure as hell didn't want to deal with my crazy parents. So far, so good though.

guys how do we overthrow blumfpht? ,"You Trumpettes are a cancer on society. Just because no information has been leaked does ***not*** mean there is no information gathered, just that they're being careful so that there can be no corruption of evidence or witnesses prior to the final report being released. If you had more than one braincell between the lot of you, you might just realise that the lack of leaks of any minor evidence against Trump is a bad sign for him and his supporters. A competent prosecution will, and obviously has, gathered all the facts before going public with their case, to ensure a thorough and successful case. A prosecution who doesn't have anything to prosecute (either through lack of evidence or evidence there was no crime in the first place), will quickly let it be known so they don't waste their own time. And just to cover the ""13 angry Democrats"" claims, Mueller is a registered Republican, as are a number of his team, making it bipartisan and interested only in the truth. Trump is going to face impeachment proceedings, there is no doubt of that, his corrupt business practices have ensured that; and if everyone who has worked in the White House (and subsequently left/been fired) since his inauguration is subpoenaed by Congress, he won't last the first day of questioning."

"[Serious]For those who deal with crippling depression, how do you deal it? How do you find any purpose in your own existence? ",I take 8 pills every day just to feel somewhat normal.
"[Serious]For those who deal with crippling depression, how do you deal it? How do you find any purpose in your own existence? ","If anyone's looking for depression credentials (the lamest kind), I've had treatment-resistant depression for 11 years and am on disability for depression. I've been on 16 medications, had electroconvulsive therapy and seen 12 therapists and 12 doctors (coincidentally). The first thing you do is get treatment: see a psychiatrist, see a therapist, take medication as directed. I would suggest looking for a therapist trained in a specific kind of therapy, because they just tend to be more educated and competent in general; if you're not familiar with therapeutic approaches I would go around asking for cognitive behavioral therapy. Even if you only get a partial response, it helps a *lot*. It can make a difference. You have to keep trying to find stuff that works for you (for medication and therapists), and if you give up on treatment you are giving up on yourself. It's not true that you're guaranteed to find a drug that will put you into long-term remission, because that doesn't really happen with treatment-resistant depression, but most people either find remission or something close enough to it. The next thing you want are the supplementals: stuff that is helpful, but don't qualify as treatments for depression. Stuff that helps your body and brain function better tends to help depression, so eating healthily, exercising and getting enough sleep are important (*especially* sleep); people like to tout the benefits of exercise, but it is only likely to be helpful (not your saving grace). Half an hour of mindfulness meditation per day has been shown to help depression (I recommend The Mind Illuminated by John Yates), and if your mood dips in the fall/winter it can't hurt to invest in a SAD lamp (you shine it in your face for a hour a day in these seasons, like while you're fucking around online.). There are some supplements that are arguably helpful, but you should ask your doctor about which ones: the internet is full of nonsense. What you do with all this depends on where you are with your illness and its treatment, and what you want to do. I'm very goal-oriented, and I find that knowing what I really want is useful to motivate me to continue to seek treatment, do all the supplemental things, and try to function despite my depression. After I failed 2 grades in high school and went on medical leave from community college, it took me a long time to recover from learned helplessness; I'd invested so much time and effort and energy in stuff that never had a chance to pan out, and I didn't want it to happen again. But this year I started to work out of it: I started writing fiction for ten minutes a day, and then I added a biology and an algebra class to it (stuff I found for free online). Eventually it got up to 90 minutes a day per thing, and writing shot up to 3 hours a day. Then I went back to school when I'd been away for 5 years, and made a 4.0; I only took two classes, but I am also still disabled from mental illness, so I think it evens out. How do I find purpose in my existence? The same way anyone else does: find what you value, find what you're passionate about, and chase the intersection. I want to be a novel-writing behavioral neurologist, so that's my thing: I'm not going to get better, so I have to learn how to function well enough to succeed in an MD-PhD program ... or just going to school full time, period. Having goals helps me be a healthier person because I have to be healthier to reach them. Here are some helpful resources if you're having mental health issues, and/or are feeling suicidal: * A [list of suicide hotlines](http://www.suicide.org/international-suicide-hotlines.html), organized by country * A [really good guide to coping with suicidal thoughts](https://www.helpguide.org/articles/suicide-prevention/are-you-feeling-suicidal.htm) * A [really good guide to coping with depression](https://www.helpguide.org/articles/depression/coping-with-depression.htm) * A [guide on how to find a therapist](http://www.webmd.com/anxiety-panic/guide/how-to-find-therapist); it's WebMD, but the guide itself is very good * A [list of tips on how to find a mental health provider](http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/mental-illness/in-depth/mental-health-providers/art-20045530) * A [mental health chatroom full of nice, supportive people (but no mental health professionals)](http://mellochat.com/village.html) (I'm a regular there) Note: If you're ever concerned that you might injure/kill yourself, go to an emergency room; they can help you there.

"Reddit is now an open world RPG. What are some of the zones, dungeons, NPCs, monsters and other features of this world? ","Each Post is an item, and their cost and rarity come from the amount of upvotes they receive. Each person can craft new items, and require other players to buff them with their blessings. The subreddits are all towns in a larger map, and each one has different resources that allow you to create unique items and treasures, hoping that they eventually lead to the larger trade city r/all someday and be blessed. Blessings are given to both the item and the person who crafted the item, giving them XP in order to level up. Levelling up does absolutely nothing aside from give bragging rights. NPCs are the moderators. They are the guards of each town. They behave similar to players, but instead are often mean, selfish, and destroy carefully crafted items upon creation if they aren't pure enough or good enough for the town. Monsters are the 'Promoted' ads. Honestly, we haven't figured out how to kill them yet, so we just live with them in our lives, wandering through our towns, annoying us slightly but never really doing any meaningful damage. NSFW subreddits are dungeons. In there, nothing is safe or sacred. You can encounter the worst most terrifying gore that will leave you burned and hurt, but it's in the NSFW dungeons that some of the most treasured items can be found. Good luck, new Redditor/Adventurer. Make your items, receive your blessings, and hopefully you will rise to glory or find your home among the dungeons of this world."

What‚Äôs the dumbest thing you or someone you know has done to ‚Äòcheat the system‚Äô? ,"I picked up my friend who was on probation to take him to his meeting where he suspected he‚Äôd be drug tested. Well he‚Äôd smoked some pot the day before and needed some way to have it not show up. When I arrived at his sister‚Äôs house to pick him up, he was standing outside vomiting. He gets in the car and I'm immediately struck with the smell of chlorine. He proceeds to tell me, that fearing the impending drug test, he‚Äôd drank a cup of bleach and a cup of vinegar. His tongue was completely white, he was throwing up into a bag the whole way there. I insist on taking him to the hospital but he refuses, telling me if he misses his appointment he will go to jail. I tell him whether or not he passes the drug test they are going to know he took something because his breath smelled like bleach and his tongue is white. But he has a plan for that as well. We get to the probation building and he pops in a piece of chewing gum and goes inside. He comes back a couple minutes later and tells me he mixed up his dates and that he didn‚Äôt have a meeting that day. He then decided he wanted to go to the hospital because he was afraid of dying. They pump his stomach. They tried to hold him there to evaluate him for attempted suicide but he convinces them that he wasn‚Äôt trying to kill himself but only after telling them the real reason why he drank the bleach. They get pretty upset about it and wind up calling his probation officer, and after he recovers he is arrested for a drug violation."

What's the difference between reading a book and watching TV? [Serious] ,When I'm reading a book I'm able to analyze the characters and interpret the story on what feels like a more personal level than TV. It makes me more engaged with the story.
What's the difference between reading a book and watching TV? [Serious] ,"When you see a show, you're watching a story unfold. You remain a separate entity. But when you read, you not only get to follow a story but you get inside the head of the characters. This allows nuance that TV shows often struggles to convey, or will rely on exposition to show. I'm not sure how true it is but i've read somewhere that as a result people who read often tend to be more empathetic."
What's the difference between reading a book and watching TV? [Serious] ,"When you watch TV pretty much all the information is given to you--so the show does all the heavy lifting. When you read a book, you have to do part of the lifting as you create a reading rhythm, visualize the action, etc."
What is one conspiracy theory you actually believe? ,Darn lol
What is one conspiracy theory you actually believe? ,"As it turns out, there's [a much more boring explanation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gatTqg_nldc) for the mattress store situation. Basically it boils down to the fact that they're high-margin items, so a given store doesn't need to sell very many in order to stay in business. And Mattress Firm saw an opportunity in the last few years to buy up many of its competitors, which is why so many of them are Mattress Firms - the same thing happened with Starbucks in the 90's."

I also hope it doesn't send me to hell because I don't agree with all the pain and suffering in the world and I don't like the ways things are being run."
What's the most compelling evidence we have that an after life exists? ,"The world has NOT been around millions of years first off. And the end for a nonbeliever is hell.

What's the most compelling evidence we have that an after life exists? ,"The Bible talks about the end times. There isn't going to be an extinction. God is in control and won't let anything that doesn't need to happen, happen. Yly hear of people talk about ""I shouldn't be alive"" but they are because God allowed them to be. Death, for a believer, is not the end."

[Serious] Has anyone had any experience with retroactive jealousy and how did you overcome it? ,"Another beautiful reply. I'm sure it'll be hard, no doubt about that, even though you're right. I will try to do my best when it comes to it and i really hope i can get over this, i try to stay positive, thank you"
[Serious] Has anyone had any experience with retroactive jealousy and how did you overcome it? ,"I'm glad I could help in some way with your struggle. It feels good to know that what was once a crippling thought cloud of mine is now something I feel strong enough to help others overcome. &amp;#x200B; Now onto your question, simply put: its a ""rational"" thought created by an irrational thought process. Yes, the thought of your significant other with another man (let alone 2) is troubling for any man to think about. Its basic human nature to want to secure and protect what we love, and this is a perfect example. From here though, things do get a bit complex: &amp;#x200B; \-I have felt this ""rush of anger and disgust"" before. When I was controlled by my RJ, I would find myself becoming angry and employing the ""why did she do that?!?!"" mentality when thinking of her past encounters. I never confronted her about, I knew it wasn't my place and that this problem was still mine and mine alone. After a month or two of becoming gradually more upset by these thoughts I came to the realization that I was thinking about it completely wrong. I took a step back, and realized how toxic and hypocritical my thoughts were. If YOU had the chance, and you may have already, wouldn't you love to have sex with two girls at the same time? Wouldn't YOU love to have had a chance to explore yourself sexually? Put yourself in her shoes, would YOU want someone berating you over something that you did when you were trying to enrich your life? Every person is entitled to their own ability to live their lives exactly how they want, your hypothetical girlfriend included. I don't mean to sound critical, but this realization is as black and white as it gets. &amp;#x200B; Once you realize that you can't control her past anymore than she can, it simply becomes mind over matter. Read those steps posted earlier about how to keep your mind occupied, and never give yourself a chance to even think about it. Lastly, if you truly love her and she truly loves you, nothing else really matters. Love is not just loving how she looks, her smarts, her personality, etc. To love someone is to love them completely, even the parts she may not like or you may not be the biggest fan of. Emotions are stronger than Retroactive Jealousy, love her unconditionally and this will fade."
[Serious] Has anyone had any experience with retroactive jealousy and how did you overcome it? ,"First of all, thanks a lot for this reply, i didn't expect anyone to reply to this anymore. Second, im gonna save your comment cause i feel like i might have to remind myself of this in the future. I'm very glad to hear you've found a wonderul girl/relationship and that you managed to overcome this fucked up shit thats retroactive jealousy.. Lastly though, my question is, when i imagine my (hypothetical) girlfriend, getting fucked or getting fucked by 2 dudes, i not only automatically start judging her (feeling that she's a 'slut' for letting herself get fucked by 2 dudes) but i also just get this rush of anger and disgust.. Did you have this too? And if so, does that also go away or will that stay?"

Lost in Japan by Shawn Mendes on Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve on ABC! I now LOVE that song! I hope Mendes performs that again live on 12/31/2019 next year! At least i'm playing that and blasting it loud as hell then! But on New Year's Day, it sucks because there's nothing to do... just stay home all day and wait for things to go back to normal the following day on January 2. The Only GOOD thing that happened on New Year's Day was on 1/1/2011 at night when ABC Kids airings of two episodes of my favorite show That's So Raven aired on ABC at 5pm. (it was preempted from its original 10am timeslot because of a parade airing instead). I LOVE that hour! I never actually get to go out at night and celebrate at someone else's house but maybe next year I'd like to! But anyway if New Year's Day sucks for you how does it?

Making a good flight is in the details of who you're traveling with and factoring in the length of the flight. Short flights are great for meeting new people and maybe making a new friend (assuming at least one adjacent seat has a stranger). Very few places exist anymore where you are mostly free from external distractions, unless you willingly turn your devices off. While those that have no desire to chat will make it evident early on, most people would *like* to meet someone new. If your group is traveling with kids on a particularly longer flight, everything is in the planning. We generally find a new coloring book, toy, or activity that we present to them once the plane is ready to take off. This combined with snacks and not feeling bad about just getting up with them and walking a couple loops can make the trip smoother. Could say more, but i'm sure there'll be more valuable comments to be made here! Enjoy your trip!"
What are some good airplane tips to ensure both you and your fellow passengers have an enjoyable flight? (SERIOUS) ,Agreed. Guess I dont really go anywhere for a reason lol

[Serious] Native Americans of Reddit what is an appropriate way to satirize someone who falsely claimed tribal ancestry? ,"Listen, you go ahead and turn your attention to whomever and whatever you want. But there are some things you should understand. Worrying about mascots is a waste of your time and energy, and doesn't even make sense. No serious polling has any significant number of American Indians offended at such things, it's not up to them if they do, it would make no sense for teams like the Washington Redskins or the Cleveland Indians to take on that name in order to be deliberately insulting -- it's a sort of compliment -- and you don't hear those of Irish descent bitching about Notre Dame. They don't ""profit from caricatures"" -- they profit from success on the field, mostly, and from their geographical location, since those are the factors that attract fans. If you're from, say, Iowa, by your logic you'd be a *fan* of the Redskins, not their bitter and impotent foe. I'm not expressing my ""feelings."" I spent some years teaching and when my students answered with, ""I feel like...,"" I interrupted them by telling them that I asked what they *thought*. Don't be emotion-driven. We've got a bigger problem with big institutions than mascots -- universities, governments, and corporations hiring on a racial basis, as they did in Senator Warren's case. After a while, I just start to suspect that you and others who sound as you do are just bitching to hear your own heads rattling."
What is the best way to get a fair price when buying a car? ,The best feeling is KNOWING you got a good price because at least 10% of those dealerships are going to play ball for a quick and easy sale. The cherry on top is not needing to step foot in a dealership or talk to any hacks until you have the upper hand. Visiting dealerships is tiring. Having the deal done before walking in gives you the strength to say no to all the extras they offer through the closing process.
What is the best way to get a fair price when buying a car? ,"friend did this about 10-12 years ago with a dodge he was after. same steps 1-5, though I think faxes were involved. He got a good deal and had to drive 90 minutes, but was ready to do most his maintenance and such so bottom line price was more important than any extra maintenance/incentives."
What is the best way to get a fair price when buying a car? ,"Never buy it brand new from a dealer. You'll pay about 30 percent more for it. The best way, in my opinion, is to get pre-approved for a loan at the bank and then buy one out of the newspaper or off craigslist. It's more of a hassle, but you'll get a much better price and won't get screwed over as much. I always see people advertising their 2 year old cars or trucks because they took out a loan of more than they could really handle so they got to get rid of it. The problem with that is, they will want to sell it for what they still owe on it. But I've been lucky. I got a 2 year old Ford Focus sold to me for what the bank said was the real loan value. In a perfect setting, this is what you want to do. Buy a vehicle for what the bank says is the loan value. Keep looking until you find one. It might take a while, but they're out there."
What is the best way to get a fair price when buying a car? ,"Use the internet to your advantage... Step 1: know the exact car make, model, trim, and colour you want. Step 2: find up to 20 dealerships around you that you‚Äôd be willing to travel to for the purchase Step 3: research the email addresses of a sales person and the sales manager at each of those dealerships Step 4: draft a concise email stating that you will be buying the exact make/model/trim of car in less than 30 days... what is their best ‚ÄúOn The Road‚Äù price. Step 5: Take the top 4-5 and give them 1 last chance to come in at a better price. Be transparent with the best offer. Look for extras if they can‚Äôt reduce price (oil changes, winter mats, Sirius XM, etc.). Step 6: Visit the dealership with the best offer and, before signing, give the runner up one last chance to beat it (don‚Äôt drive more than an hour away for less than $1-200 difference - respect the deal and everyone‚Äôs time). Buy the best offer. Bonus points: Find the dealer incentive website (if it exists), time the purchase at the end of a month or quarter when quotas might be tight, time the purchase on a model you know will be going through an overhaul the following year, purchase on a slower night (weeknights and snowstorms are good combos). Proof: Last car I bought was a New 2016 Honda Odyssey EX. Contacted 20 dealers from Peterborough to Windsor in mid-Feb 2016. Honda Downtown and Brantford had best prices. Found the dealer incentive page and after negotiating them down, grabbed another $2,500 cash incentive which dropped in March. Bought the van for $36,700 cash all in. Saved ~$10,000 off MSRP. Went with Honda Downtown. Brantford couldn‚Äôt believe the deal and was happy to lose this one. Paid March 1st on a Tuesday night at 7pm during a bad snow storm. Picked it up later in March. After 2 years and only 30k KM I just sold it privately for $33K."

"In your opinion, is there such a thing as 'going to far' in comedy, why or why not? ","As long as you do it in a legit comedy forum than I am fine with anything. So being on a stage in a room full of adults who chose to be there means anything goes. It is just performance art. Yelling offensive things to strangers on the sidewalk because you think it is funny isn't performance art, it is just harassing people and being a dick. Censoring comedy is like saying artists can't paint certain things you think are offensive. Again the same concept applies. Paint what you want but put it in a museum. You can't spray-paint a swastika on your neighbors house and call it a painting."
"In your opinion, is there such a thing as 'going to far' in comedy, why or why not? ",Ask Louis C.K.

"In your opinion, is there such a thing as 'going to far' in comedy, why or why not? ",Nope. Things that cannot be made jokes out of are things not worth talking about.
"In your opinion, is there such a thing as 'going to far' in comedy, why or why not? ","No. But one of the most important aspects of comedy is timing. If this joke came from pre-scandal C.K. It would just be him being him. He has always had this type of joke, it‚Äôs part of what propelled him to the top when he did. Now, given the fact he isn‚Äôt in the prime spot and golden child, his same old style of comedy won‚Äôt go over the same way as it did before. I think ‚Äúknowing‚Äù what we know about him that joke is coming from a different person from our point of view. I understand the sentiment that he has gone too far, given his position today. TLDR: comedy can‚Äôt go too far, but a comedian can."

[Serious] How did you avoid being kidnapped by that one shady person back when you were a kid? ,Thats scary.
[Serious] How did you avoid being kidnapped by that one shady person back when you were a kid? ,It even ran through my mind that he could be lying. But the urge to help a strange old man totally dominated
[Serious] How did you avoid being kidnapped by that one shady person back when you were a kid? ,I've had three close encounters. The first happened when I was five and I was playing with my friend in the kiddie pool. She had a noise barrier type of wall separating her backyard from the street. On this day when we were playing a man jumped up onto the wall and asked how old we were. After we each responded the man said he has a daughter about my age and wanted to know if she came around to play in the pool since he couldn't find her. We told him we haven't seen her and he left. He came back a little while later asking if I'd leave with him to look for his daughter. I felt guilty because I wanted to help him but I didn't want to leave the pool. He left without incident.
[Serious] How did you avoid being kidnapped by that one shady person back when you were a kid? ,My mother tells me I was standing at the end of our driveway and a car was stopped in front of it with a female driver. My mother says when she became in view of the driver she sped away.
[Serious] How did you avoid being kidnapped by that one shady person back when you were a kid? ,"He asked if I wanted to make some money and then I said no and walked away really fast. Also, another time I was about to walk inside from my drive way when a guy started talking to me. He eventually said ""come here"" and I was scared, but I was running out of things to say in order not to. Luckily my mom was mad at me and yelled for me to get inside and finish cleaning. And this other time a man followed me around a park and wanted me to talk to him and pet his dog, but I was about nine or ten this time and less afraid to show apprehension, so he eventually backed off and said "" That's alright you shouldn't talk to strangers"" he repeatedly said something to this effect and eventually walked away. I saw him peeking at me through his curtains a little while later as I passed the apartments adjacent to the park."

Some of it is, where you're putting the blame for some of the things you talk about (i.e., jobs going over sees? The companies put the jobs where they're cheaper, to save money. THey could have kept them in America. Personally, I blame them. Then I remember, no American would pay the $12,000 they'd have to pay for a good TV that was 'Made in America'. I don't want to get too carried away. I Appreciate the thought you put in to this ... I'll get back to you. :) Hope you had a good holiday."

[serious] other than just supporting your party for the sake of supporting your party....why do you support Donald Trump? ,"Thank you for being so respectful. I‚Äôll answer your points one by one, best I can, and I‚Äôll try to be just as respectful:) sorry if it‚Äôs not in order. I realize we are living in a globalized world, and that‚Äôs a fact of life. However, I think we have taken that concept too far. No one (Trump included) is arguing for globalism to simply go away. Rather, we just want it implemented in a way that is fair to us. I don‚Äôt see it as ‚Äúfuck the rest of the world‚Äù. I see it as ‚Äúmake sure we‚Äôre not being screwed by the rest of the world‚Äù, but still be fair to them. Making sure we are being fairly treated does not equal fuck everyone else. We can have global communications and fast travel and global trade and all the stuff you mentioned, while still taking care of national interests. It‚Äôs not mutually exclusive And yes, I do believe that Obama, Bush, Clinton, and Carter did damage America in favor of global society, through things such as the TPP and Paris agreement. We pulled out of it, and we STILL lead the world in emission reductions. We are falling apart, yet we somehow have money to send to other nations and rack up debt. Hence the whole idea of America First. That‚Äôs literaly why this whole thing gained traction in the first place. I will give Obama some credit for pulling us out of the recession. BUT he also allowed the national debt and government spending to explode to unsustainable levels while doing so, which is going to seriously hurt us later on. Not if, but when. And yes, Trump makes friends with some pretty bad people, such as Valadimir Putin. But that‚Äôs better than going to war with them. Every president has done this with unsavory leaders. Remember, at one time, Joseph Stalin, who killed more people than Hitler, was our ally because circumstances demanded it. Next, the issue with the press is they ONLY report what makes him look bad. They never report anything that could make him look good. There‚Äôs no balance there. And yeah, I‚Äôll admit healthcare sucks. You win that one, no argument here. And yes, extreme nationalism got us into both world wars. But there‚Äôs a huge difference. Every major power, except us and Great Britain was literaly slaughtering millions of people based on race. As bad as the rhetoric is, we are not even close to any such thing here. And I don‚Äôt think such polices could ever gain any significant support whatsoever here. All Trump supporters want is to maybe slow down the pace of immigration, let them assimilate. I garuntee the majority of us are actually happy to see people immigrate here. The key is ASSIMILATION. We want them to become truly American, and show at least the most basic level of respect for our country. We just don‚Äôt want millions of them at a time, who have no respect for us or our laws (hence the hatred of illegal immigrants). And I don‚Äôt see anything wrong with taking a line from Regan. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs truly stealing if you‚Äôre running a campaign on a similar ideology, and many supporters are already comparing the two. Lastly, as far as the shooting part, I‚Äôve read several studies, and what they‚Äôve found is that if you take out places with the most gun control, such as Chicago, Baltimore, and so on, the country is actually much safer. The places with the most gun related laws almost universally have higher rates of gun violence. And yes the banks are being greedy, which caused the recession, and Obama was right to take them on. I hope I was equally respectful in my response, and happy new year"
[serious] other than just supporting your party for the sake of supporting your party....why do you support Donald Trump? ,"We live in a world where you can be in Europe or Asia in about (or LESS than) 12 hours. In a world where people (friends, family, and businesses) can have real time, face to face (via the webcams and HD tvs) meetings literally around the world. In a world where the polluted air and water can't possible respect our borders. And a worlds where a pilot can leave their house in the states, get in a plane, and fly to the middle east and drop a nuclear weapon on a target, and be home at their own table around breakfast the next morning. On top of that, most of the products you use every day (I guarantee) were made in another country, and imported, meaning most of the worlds major economies are inextricably linked ... permanently, and forever. Most of them using the States as a sort of a hub. How are we not a global society? And why is it better to worry about yourself exclusively, and fuck the rest of the world? It's the same mentality that got us into World Wars I and II. How can you not see that? And do you really think America hasn't been looking out for itself first this entire time? Do you really feel that Obama? Clinton? Carter? and all of the other democrats were so for the 'global society', that they wantonly and willingly neglected or did damage to America? President Obama pulled America out of an economic recession so bad it very nearly became the next depression, which in turn saved the worlds economy. A recession - incidentally - that was instigated by the unabashed, outright greed of the American banks and financial sector (and people like Pres Trump), on the backs of the very Americans who wear his swag, and attend his rallies. I LITERALLY don't understand people like you. Much the same way I'm sure you don't understand people like me. President Trump is a cheat, and a liar, and a narcissist, and greedy, and frankly not very smart. He's a bully. He tells 7 year olds they shouldn't believe in Santa clause, AT Christmas. He yells and screams that the press is lying when they report - with proof and evidence - something that he doesn't like, or that makes him look bad. He literally tries to shut them down. He makes friends with some of the most vile, evil, and horrible 'leaders' on the planet. Literally MURDERERS. And you support him - because he said he'd ""MAGA"" (A line he blatantly stole from Reagan, incidentally). He announces and even writes policy via Twitter. HE makes it impossible to have respect for him as a man, and he tarnishes the office of the Presidency, and the Republican party. America is at it's greatest when it's LEADING the global society. Obviously you have to look after yourself first ... no one's expecting otherwise. You can't lead if you're falling apart. But you're shooting each other to death daily, and by the 10's of thousands a year. On top of that, only your richest can afford practical healthcare. When are you going to START looking after yourselves?! I'm Canadian. All of that is just my opinion. I hope you'll note, before you reply, that I didn't call you names, or yell (I admit to caps, for emphasis, not volume), and I was (I think) very respectful in my disagreement. I respect your right to your opinion, no matter how strongly I disagree with it. And frankly, I outright demand the same respect. (Just putting it out there, more for anyone else that may feel the need to comment, than you.) I hope you have a Happy New Year. :)"

If you had a choice between dating someone you love (who doesn't love you) or date someone who loves you (who you don't love) which would you choose? Why? ,"Eyyy, I'll take the former because I'm already in that situation lol. Honestly I couldn't do it the other way around. I'm an extremely introspective and hard willed person, which is the only reason I feel I can be in my situation and actually feel confident that it's still worth it and I'm not being driven by fear. Presumably that's why my partner can trust me when I say it's worth it. If someone loved me I would fear that I was taking advantage constantly. I suppose maybe there's someone out there who could convince me that they know themselves so well and have the will to act in their best interests no matter how hard that I might be able to trust that, but it's gotta be rare. Of course now I've typed all that out I realize it makes me sound like a massive narcissist who thinks nobody could be as self aware and willful as me. Well shucks."

What is the worst new years experience you've ever had? ,"This is going to be long. My girlfriend and I were celebrating our first new years together. That consisted of going to her work friends house and playing board games and drinking. The night did not go like that. My girlfriend and I arrive at like 7-8 and we just chill until another work friend of theirs gets there. Once she arrives we go out to a liquor shop and buy some alcohol. After we go to a bar for a bit. At 10 we get back to the apartment and start playing games, cooking and listening to music all while drinking. Here where it gets awful. My girlfriend was on medication for her anxiety and it did not mix with alcohol that well. Eventually, the night leads to my girlfriend trying to jump off the second story balcony to kill herself, her friend is in her room crying, my girlfriend is crying, the other girl is too. I have to babysit 3 grown ass women for NYE. I have to stop people from trying to hurt themselves, I had to stop people from crying, I had to carry one of the girls to the bathroom because she puked on her bed. I took the sheet off the bed while the girl that was puking still had her head in the toilet. My girlfriend was trying to leave, she was being argumentative, just a big old brat. Long story short I had to clean puke off someone and her bed sheet. I had to keep an eye out for my girlfriend because she was being unpredictable. I had to do dishes, well not had to, I just did them. I slept in front of the door on the floor that night. Worst night I've ever had."

Stuff like oatmeal you can make overnight and it makes for a good breakfast, certain foods and dishes can keep up to a week in the fridge. Make spending on stuff like rent and food a priority. If you have roommates you can share the costs of stuff like soap, toilet paper, cleaning utilities... Etc. It would be useful to keep a journal of sorts to help with planning stuff out.

Any ways to not look desperate when making friends? ,maybe understanding sarcasm would be a good start
Any ways to not look desperate when making friends? ,"Don't overthink it, try to be as relaxed as possible. There's a noticeable difference between someone chill talking to you and someone that clearly is having a panic attack inside his mind. Try not to judge yourself, people might or might not like to talk to you, and that's ok, doen't say anything about your personality or you if someone doesn't wanna talk"
Any ways to not look desperate when making friends? ,"Lmao just drop the ""act"" part. Stop being something else and stop worrying about unimportant bs. Friends should come naturally, i have never interacted to other person with ""please be my friend"" mindset. You do stuff together with people, you interact, speak with the other guy, share a few laughs. And boom he remembers you well enough to have the ""need"" to spend hes time with you again."
Any ways to not look desperate when making friends? ,"Don‚Äôt get too clingy too fast. It can really freak someone out if you contact them too much, talk a lot about how great they are, or like follow them around. You just want to figure out more about them and what they like before putting your friend crush on display. It‚Äôs not a specific formula where you wait like three days before contact or something like that. You just kinda roll with it. Also maybe avoid putting yourself down in anyway like you would try to do on a first date. Not sure if that makes any sense or helps, but yeah."

The night of the date, I decided to go to the bathroom before he got there. When I came out, he was there talking to my dad. We made small talk for a minute and then started to headed out.

"People who have dislocated a shoulder before, how was the pain/experience and did you fix it at home or get it done professionally? ","I was playing basketball, went up for a dunk with one hand, got rim blocked, I fell all the way to the ground and landed directly on my left shoulder. I dislocated my shoulder and broke my shoulder blade. The pain was the worse I could explain. I got up, arm dangling, bent down grabbed my sunglasses and keys and left the park. Got to my truck and rotated my arm the best in could, felt a sickening pop. Got in the truck, pulled my left arm over my lap with my right arm, put my seat belt on and drove myself to the hospital. Doctor finished rotating my arm and setting it in place I guess, another worse pain experience, and thay was with a shot of dillotta or something. Then found the shoulder blade was broken . Worse summer ever."
"People who have dislocated a shoulder before, how was the pain/experience and did you fix it at home or get it done professionally? ",The pain was intense at the instant it dislocated. A few times when it happened my knees went weak and I dropped like a rock. But then after about 20 or 30 seconds the pain would subside enough for me to relax the muscles in my shoulder and it would slip back into place on its own. I ended up getting multiple surgeries to stabilize the joint.

How do you deal with jealousy? ,"First, jealousy and envy are different things. Envy-coveting what others have is easier to deal with; I remind myself that there are 7+billion people and I‚Äôm better off than somewhere nearly 650+ million. For jealousy I‚Äôm not sure there‚Äôs much to do but we honest with/about whatever it is you don‚Äôt want to lose and remind yourself that the feeling is an internal one and showing/expressing that jealous feeling can often lead to the exact outcome you wanted to avoid. I don‚Äôt even know how to do it but I‚Äôm sure some can channel that jealousy into a drive/commitment to keep earning what they have. At the end of the day though it‚Äôs a problem people have dealt with literally forever and there is no good solution,"

"Humans of Reddit, what about Antarctica would you like to have explained to you by the penguins? ","Do you tell your chicklins the ancient myths your parents whispered to you as you huddled together from the bitter wind thst blew from inland. Do you remember the stories you were told when you were a chick, to give you strength before the many cursed miles you had to walk to get to the sea to feed on the morrow? ""Let me tell you the story of the King of Penguins. He who was three times taller than any penguin alive today, and so strong that the vicious King of Leopard Seals and the evil Queen of Orcas left his subjects in peace to thrive on the beaches, for many years. That is, until one day, when the monstrous King Walrus had a dream that the countless numbers of penguins his harem shared the beaches with, would one day eat all of the fish in the sea. So he challenged the King of Penguins to a race around the continent with the promise of claim to the beaches closest to the richest hunting grounds to the winner. Our great ancestor agreed, for the walrus King was very fat and slow, and smelly, and his hideous wife's and children would never be able outswim his own glorious kin, so fast and nimble were they. He made King Walrus agree that the loser of the race must take his people inland and leave the beaches, and return only at the peak of summer when fish were most plentiful and he could be sure his penguin subjects would not got without. The fateful day of the race arrived, and the great King gracefully slid on his beautiful feathered white belly down the beach to meet the lumbering King of Walruses, whose own great scarred belly shook the ground as he dragged himself to the sea. Once in the water, our King quickly realized that the walrus was no longer hindered by his mass, and swam with a power, grace and speed that almost matched the pace of the penguin. Almost, but not quite, and our great King and sire laughed in joy as he dashed off around the continent. But the King of Penguins had been cruely tricked, for as soon as our great king set off, soaring like an albatross through the dark waters, the lazy walrus turned around and returned to his many wife's to await the return of his foe and claim his beach. He had no fear for the great bird's return, for he was the greatest walrus that ever lived and would swiftly dispatch the penguin with his monstrous tusks should he confront him. Our great King knew nothing of this betrayal, and swam fast and hard, his heart light in his chest and a smile in his eyes, imagining the brown mass of his competitor to be always behind the last turn around the jagged coatline. He swam for weeks and weeks, until the day grew dark and the seas covered by thin sheets of ice. One day he stopped to hunt, filling his belly with fish, and with mirth, he stopped to wait for his enemy and laughed to himself imagining him dancing around the huge beast and dashing off into the horizon. He waited a full day and night, but there was no sign of the walrus. The next morning he woke from a light slumber, to restart his journey, but as he readied himself to dive from his sea ice bed, he caught a terrible sight. A dozen sharp black teeth pierced the white sea, rapidly approaching his location. He realized too late that he had been trapped, and followed not by the walrus, but by the terrible Queen of the Orcas and her grinning children. He dove away as fast ad he could, but the black and white beasts could swim for weeks without tiring. He had already lost most of his summer fat, and his dashes grew more and more desperate. The last trace that was ever seen of our great brave King was by the Prince of the Albatrosses, from the skies far above, who told the penguins of what he saw years later when he next set foot on land. The King of Walrus claimed the best lands from the defenceless penguin city, who were lost without their King. And so his ancestors, us, are forever doomed to walk many miles inland to seek sanctuary from our enemies, the descendents of the Queen of Orcas and the King of Leopard Seals. We grew smaller and weaker without plentiful food, and often lost our way on our way to the sea and in trying to find our pack again in the shifting snow and ice fields of the encroaching winter. Our numbers greatly declined and twice a year we are forced to shuffle pass the walrus herds who lounge on the beaches, laughing at our shame. And so tomorrow, our little chickling, we must start our trek to the edge of the land, so we can teach you to always look for those that would take you away from us, to swim and feed in the same hunting grounds that once fed the King of Penguins."""

"People who live in small towns, what don't city people understand about small town life?

Why doesn‚Äôt everyone just buy their food from fruit and veg shops and local butchers?‚Äù At the time I lived in a small town about an hour from a major regional centre however I was lucky in that it had a large chain supermarket so I could get everything I needed grocery wise. However the only fruit and veg store in the town lasted all of four months before closing down. It just couldn‚Äôt get the business because of the town demographic - high unemployment levels, drugs etc. However when people would explain these kinds of reasons to Tegan on Facebook it would turn into ‚ÄúWell can‚Äôt you just drive into the city once a week?‚Äù No, people don‚Äôt have a spare $50 for fuel lying around. ‚ÄúThen maybe start a fresh food co-op with the community?‚Äù The only thing I know people are growing in this community is weed. ‚ÄúWell you can probably source local honey if you try?‚Äù It always came down to people in small towns with low socioeconomic status had the exact same opportunities as those in the city, they were just too stupid to notice.‚Äù"
"People who live in small towns, what don't city people understand about small town life? ","Rent is usually cheaper. Gas and car wear-and-tear make it expensive.

Why is critical thinking unnecessary in order for humans to survive? ,"I think humans can survive thinking instinctively. But critical thinking has helped us progress forward and evolve to the technologically advanced society we are now. We can tell when certain thoughts or ideas outpace society. I.e. Misuse of technology, misuse of weapons, sensationalism in news/media. So we have to correct those things, then continue progressing forward critics thinking and learn from those errors. Just my thoughts."

I think the most important thing with a New Years resolution is not to be too ambitious. Like mine for 2018 was ‚Äústart running‚Äù. Nothing about how often I would run, could be once a week or once every couple of weeks, but as long as I was running more than I was in 2017 it was fulfilled. So my NYR this year is to eat healthier. No specific targets, just as long as I‚Äôm not eating chocolate and crisps every other day, I know I‚Äôve done better than 2018 :)"

What movie scene actually made you cry? ,"It's not really a scene for me, but The Crisis brings me to tears every time I hear it. It's a piano song, from 7 Pounds, with Will Smith. It's soft, slow, sweet. But also dissonant. Like for a whole year you were cold, and when you finally got to see the sun it was bright and shining but not warm. Those first gentle beams where you know it's not right but it's SUPPOSED TO BE, but you're having a hard time accepting it. Or a puzzle piece where the picture is right, but the piece doesn't actually fit even though it should. I've never heard a song so strongly encapsulate my depression. That feeling that I'm young (since I was 12, for nearly 13 years straight) and talented, and fortunate, and privileged, and I couldn't care a single ounce less. That film also tied my strong desire to die with an opportunity to actually use my death to bring people some happiness. That killing myself wouldn't just be selfish. At this point, I'm doing better. The right meds, counselor, exercise, and so much more have gotten me there. But whenever I need to just FEEL something, just wrung out with grief or sadness or overwhelming hopelessness and can't bring myself to let it out as tears, I put this movie on. I feel better after having expressed myself somewhat."

What goal or milestone did you achieve this year? What‚Äôs your plan or goal for next year? ,I graduated nursing school this past year!! I'm so proud of myself! I got a job at a local long term care facility then recently another at my local hospital. I plan on working full time at the hospital and picking up shifts here and there at the ltc facility. I've started my bachelors program and am almost done with my first semester. I will be giving birth to my second son in about 5 wks after a couple heartbreaking years of miscarriages. My first son is 6 yrs old and very excited to finally be a big brother. My plan is to stay on track with my education and take time to watch this baby grow and make sure my oldest still feels the love. I'm looking forward to this coming year more than any year previous.

What goal or milestone did you achieve this year? What‚Äôs your plan or goal for next year? ,"This year I achieved a lot of things I hadn't imagined I would even be doing. I took an algebra class and a college-level intro to biology class for free online; I started writing fiction and worked my way up to 3 hours a day; and I went back to school part time when I went on medical leave 5 years ago, and made a 4.0. I even got most of the way through starting a National Alliance on Mental Illness club, and will start it next semester. Next year I'm going to finish the short story I've been writing, write at least one but probably two novels, learn to drive, continue my 4.0, and start going to school full-time in the fall. (There are issues I have to get a handle on relating to my severe depression.). Next semester, I have to see my academic advisor about what I need to take to transfer for a psych/neuro double major when my community college doesn't have a neuroscience option. (I have some example course schedules from different schools that I can work from.). This makes me sound a lot more motivated than I really am. It's a lot easier day by day than it sounds all at once."

At what age do you expect children to buy their parents presents? ,"My kids have been getting us presents since they were three or so, in the sense that they would get to go shopping with one of us and pick out something for their siblings and us. They love it and it's pretty interesting to see what random stuff they pick out. This year my three year old got me a washcloth with minions on it and her dad got a box of milkduds. Obviously we pay for it. When will they start to use their own allowances? I don't know but we will probably stop covering their gifts for others around 14/15 or so. Then it will be their call how they handle it."
At what age do you expect children to buy their parents presents? ,"No age, my parents tell us to save our money. Knowing we have bills paid and food to eat makes them happy."
At what age do you expect children to buy their parents presents? ,"Agreed, with the caveat that a good parent also wouldn't deny or discourage their children from the chance to do something nice like a gift. It's easy to get so focused on not burdening others that you forget how distancing and almost power trippy it is to refuse others the chance to lovingly do things for you."
At what age do you expect children to buy their parents presents? ,"I dunno about expect. Gifts are voluntary, in my experience if children are in an environment where gift giving is pleasing and joyful they will eagerly join in, and they should not be excluded or discouraged from that side of it. I know a lot of families do gifts more like obligations, which I think is inappropriate for anyone of any age. I can't remember the first time I got my parents and siblings presents. Buying is a key word here too, I know I made the vast majority of my early gifts to others. As I started collecting money, from gifts or whatever, my parents made sure my own money was completely under my control. Therefore I could do whatever I wanted with it and because my parents were generous and took genuine joy in gift giving I quickly and eagerly sought out and achieved that happiness as well. It wouldn't have been a big deal if I hadn't, or had taken longer to do so, or skipped a year because I was saving, etc, etc."
At what age do you expect children to buy their parents presents? ,"My kids are still young, but make us something every year. I would never expect them to buy me something."

What is your worst restaurant experience? ,"Today!! We went to a diner and it was empty except for the child of the owner who told us we were the first customers in awhile, which should have been a sign. We were seated and the son, who was about 10, stood 5 feet from the table, holding a massive stuffed anaimal snake like Britney Spears in that [one music video](http://media2.onsugar.com/files/2014/03/26/848/n/1922398/496a140068bf15cc_76369999_10mO153H.191ratio/i/Im-Slave-4-U-VMAs-Britney.jpg) and sort of danced? Stomped? Stared at us intently and with unblinking attention trying to demand us as his audience? Then we looked around saw all the decorations...whew boy. You know that Ultra-Christian wine mom aesthetic where there are wooden signs with 'kooky' handwritten sayings like ""God Bless This Mess!""? Imagine that x100, plus pro-police sayings, plus vaguely racist undertones to everything (""All police welcome except the PC police!""). We left before ordering, the creepy snake neck child looked devastated to lose his audience."
What is your worst restaurant experience? ,"Waffle House, somewhere in northern Georia (USA, just in case), at maybe 1 or 2 AM. Me and some friends were driving through the night to Florida. Popped in at a Waffle House. Sounds delicious, right? Seriously the most backwater, disgusting place I've ever been. Everyone working that night was rail-thin and looked like they were on meth. The server had a huge open would on his had, at least 2 inches long and close to an inch wide. Not scabbed over or anything, it looked wet, like it was fresh or festering. Of course, he served us our food with this hand. Oh, and the food? It was an open kitchen, so we got to watch while the cook smoked while making our food. Like, just had a cigarette hanging in his mouth the whole time dropping ash everywhere. Of the four of us, 3 got sick. Fortunately I was fine...and driving, but I literally had to pull off at every exit between Atlanta and Ft. Lauderdale so the others could shit. Worst road trip ever."

Which country other than yours do you highly respect and why? ,Wow that is really deep. I didn't know. I will look further into that. Thanks
Which country other than yours do you highly respect and why? ,"Israel. Most citizens are refugees or the descendants of refugees who were expelled penniless from their country of origin if not starved and tortured beforehand. They are the only democracy in the Middle East, the only place where gays won't be murdered, where women have equal rights to men, and where all people - regardless of religion or origin - are governed by the same laws. 17% of university students are Arab - nearly the same percentage as in the population; an Arab Supreme Court Justice (as well as a former Justice), and an Arab Miss Israel. It is surrounded by hostile entities that don't bother to disguise the fact that they want to commit genocide on the 75% of the population that is Jewish. Israel is by no means perfect and like every other nation in the world, there is unfairness and many things that need to be improved. But in comparison with other Middle Eastern states, it's far ahead. I know some people won't like this; that's their problem. I'm not Israeli but have a lot of admiration for the nation and would like to live there some day."
Which country other than yours do you highly respect and why? ,"Japan. They went from military dictatorship to tech giant in just a couple decades with American help, made modern ramen wide spread, and is just generally weird"
Which country other than yours do you highly respect and why? ,"Andorra. They are one of the smallest countries in the world, they‚Äôre located between 2 huge countries (France and Spain), they have 0.07% of the population of their neighbor countries, they have no army, they‚Äôve been there for 750 years and they were NEVER invaded.

"People of Reddit, what is your opinion about the CollegeBoard and how colleges collaborate with them? ",Agreed
"People of Reddit, what is your opinion about the CollegeBoard and how colleges collaborate with them? ","Colleges need to go back to being research and lifelong learning institutions. Right now they are this unholy union of corporate feeder program for white collar vocations and cultural icon of achievement. It feeds into the narratives of corporate slavery and disfranchised have-nots. Proper funding is the answer here. Proper = sustainable public funding of state schools. Private schools should be largely vocational/apprentice tracks, and specifically ""crowded out"" of normal entry-level career training by high quality public education. Said another way, high schools offering Calculus II are a waste. Let universities (via AP courses?) train kids who actually KNOW they want to learn thermodynamic modeling or signal processing. High schools need to do better teaching core ""adulting"" domains like civics, Internet tech, personal finance, etc."

"For bartenders/bouncer out there, what's the most interesting things that happened in yout bar? ","A sorberish guy and a drunk gay guy (him being gay is more relevent later) come in and order. Drunk guy stays quiet so I don't realize he's drunk so I won't refuse service as it is illegal to serve someone that is drunk in a pub in the UK (stupid law right). They sit in front of the bar, the place is very quiet so they are pretty much the only customers. As if do with everyone if I made eye contact I would smile at him as it is polite to do so. He seemed to find it weird that I did so and proceeded to stare at me. I kept looking over to see if he still was and he always was. After about 5 minutes he asked if I had a problem with him. I said no as I didn't. He then says well then why do you keep looking at me... (I'm thinking of a response which won't cause problems) he continues, is it because I'm gay?. At this point there was no inclination of him being so, I wouldn't care otherwise as I'm bi myself. I say no and he drops it. About 2 minutes later he is swearing really loudly. There is a family with kids on the table round the corner. I ask him politely to stop swearing. He claims it his right to swear and that it is not illegal to do so in a public house. I explain that even if it wasn't illegal (of which I'm not sure) that there was a kid around the corner and that it was disrespectful. He then tries defending himself to by saying I'm attacking him verbally for being gay. And gets louder and louder as I try to explain that it wasn't why I was asking him not to swear. His friend is trying to get him to leave at this point. He refuses. We call my manager in who was meant to have the night off as we had never had any problematic people before. She arrives and tries to calm him down, when this doesn't work, she calls the police for assistance as now she has asked him to leave he is trespassing. While on the phone to the police he is loudly claiming he is a rich published bookwrite and that he was going to take us to court for this and that he'd hire the best most expensive lawyers. He stupidly gives us his name when I ask for it (as I asked as if I wanted to find his books online). His friend is now tugging on him to get him to leave. After a couple minutes of his friend tugging on him begging him to go he finally gives in and leaves. The manager called the police back to cancel the callout and she went back home to her kids."

Then the girls he was messing with start trying to kick him while we are on the ground. I start swatting away the kicks (because they were hitting me to) and when I reach across to block one..... He latches on. From there luckily a little backup arrived... And they were not as concerned about his well being as I was. The night ended with me going to the E.R. for a tetanus shot.

What's your craziest New year's Eve party ever? ,"I was in the Navy, at a house I rented out with 3 other guys. We had at least 40 other people from the command I was at. People set up drums and electric guitars on our indoor porch and were just jamming throughout the night. Dance floor in our living room, had the grill going and alcohol flowing and people doing the unspeakable in the bedrooms. I remember police coming to about the noise, kicking people out after creeping on some of the women, breaking up a fight and the rest is kinda a haze from the liquor and the fact that this was New Year's 2006. One thing I do remember is I had my first kiss with my now wife at midnight, after the guy she came with left because she was talking to me too much. Good night."

What does abortion mean to you? ,We have too many humans anyway. I say abortion should be an option until your late 50s.
What does abortion mean to you? ,uh i think i get it.
What does abortion mean to you? ,"Being selfish in wanting to live. Many people going through depression and such often are told that it's selfish to kill themselves, but I try to tell them that it's fine to be selfish but in another way. It is because that they couldn't commit suicide that they want to live, so it's fine to be selfish but not in killing themselves. To think of themselves before others, because those who call them selfish forget to think about what that depressed person is going through and only wanting the depressed to stay alive for their sake. So because I am selfish is why I want and will keep on living, and am glad that I am allowed to be able to live. Instead of regretting my birth, even if I did ruin my mom's education, bring shame to my family, and hurt many people by just being alive... I accept that even if it is a truth, that I will be selfish and be glad that I was born. My desire is to keep living this life, even if there are going to be a lot of painful moments to come because I know there will be times where I will be happy too. It's hard to explain, but it basically keeps me and some other depressed people sane if they're going through hard times. It's a way to value our life, even if it's not valued by other people."
What does abortion mean to you? ,can you explain the selfish desire thing I dont really understand what you mean.
What does abortion mean to you? ,"I think it comes for being able to live that when I think back, I'm glad to be born. Like my life isn't that great for sure, tried to kill myself twice and was able to stop myself both times, but for the other times, I'm glad I was able to experience them. So in a sense, a selfish desire pretty much. Also although they're never born, popped out, doesn't mean that they aren't alive. Group of cells? Yes just like someone that's considered medically dead or vegetative state. You don't have to keep the child, there are many people who would love to raise them if you give them a chance. (Specifically LGBT couples)"

Don't focus on the ""no"" part, focus on the fact you were able to ask, that's how people get what they want from other people, they confidentially ask for it and are respectful when someone says no and are gracious when they say yes."

Its always been a thing I've worried about, but for some reason in September it kicked into high gear with nothing really triggering it. I started feeling like I have little time left and that I'll live life wishing to go back constantly as the best part is over. I felt that I had to leave a bunch of my habits(namely anime, video games and cartoons behind). I even started to wish I did things I never had an interest in before such as joining a fraternity(that's subsided completely for over a month). Here's hoping 2019 I can break away from this because the last 4 months have sucked."

"People that have cheated on their significant other but stayed together and turned it around and remained faithful, how did you do it? ","Ah, sorry. Well, I'm was *kinda* serious. Depending on the incident, sometimes keeping it to yourself is best. However, if your feeling towards your significant other is that you don't immediately think of them when the opportunity to cheat comes up and how much you know it would hurt them, maybe the relationship is no longer worth saving, if it ever was. In that case, maybe fessing up as honestly as possible and accepting the outcome is what has to be done. Everyone is different and every relationship is different. It's a tremendously personal thing and its impact on the relationship depends on countless factors that are difficult to quantify."

Why is the United States so successful as a country compared to other countries? ,What and the rest of us aren't? America has a few pages of history in the grand scheme of world history books. How are you defining success? Many other countries have thrived and survived for thousands of years before it even existed.
Why is the United States so successful as a country compared to other countries? ,"It's large, resource-rich, had founding populations from the most successful countries in Europe, who were freed from the grip of monarchies, and it was built on ideas thought up (and sometimes stolen) by a group of some of the greatest geniuses who have ever lived. I mean Thomas Jefferson is in a class of his own."
Why is the United States so successful as a country compared to other countries? ,"Lots of things ... A capitalist economy incentivizes productivity, growth, and innovation. Healthy economy leads to rampant consumerism, meaning there's a market for lots of goods and services, and lots of opportunities to get rich (or at least make a living) by serving that market. Elements of socialism (public schools, public roads, public health resources) give even the poorer segments of society some hope for upward mobility or at least sustainability. Having a society that's dominated by some cultures and religions - but not explicitly ruled by them - means diverse viewpoints are tolerated and even encouraged, and sometimes this leads to actual progress in health, technology, arts &amp; literature, industry, etc. Sometimes it's courage and intelligence from common citizens. Sometimes it's just outright ruthlessness from political and economic leaders. And sometimes we just totally shoot ourselves in the foot. But on balance, the nation has come out ahead. There will always be things that are fair to question, or even to demand change. But there is also much to admire and be proud of. &amp;#x200B;"

"[serious] Those who have chosen to live without children, what made you come to that and how has life been? ","I know this is an older post, but maybe you‚Äôre still interested in responses. Whatever it is that people feel when they say they want children, they love babies, they can‚Äôt wait to be a mom... I never felt that. When I tried to think about it and imagine my life as a mother, I felt uncomfortable and mildly repulsed. Whereas when I thought about my life goals and dreams and hopes, they never included motherhood, and were much more exciting and fulfilling for me. So why would I do something I don‚Äôt want, and impact not only my life and my husband‚Äôs life, but an innocent child‚Äôs life as well? Sure, pregnancy would be dangerous for me, and kids are expensive, juggling my career and motherhood would be terribly difficult ‚Äî but if I wanted children, that wouldn‚Äôt matter. I‚Äôd find a way to make it work. I just... don‚Äôt want that for my life. Speaking of, life is amazing. I‚Äôm happily married, devoting my life to a career in the performing arts, traveling all over the world, constantly studying and working, taking care of and loving my husband, and enjoying my pets (which are NOT child substitutes. I love them, but they are not kids and that‚Äôs what I like about them üòÇ). I have time for meditation and self-improvement, extra emotional energy for supporting my friends and family, and extra money to donate to causes I care about. Looking ahead to the future I see my husband and me, in a lovely home library with a fire in the fireplace, a cat or two curled up with us, reading together with some classical music on. Some people would find that intensely boring and lonely. I find it so deeply comforting that it fills my whole body with a quiet joy. And even if my husband dies or one of us gets sick or some other horrible thing befalls us ‚Äî that still doesn‚Äôt change my desire not to be a mother."

Started dating a man who has two children to an ex wife. After one week of living with them I knew that I never wanted to have kids of my own. They put me off wanting to be around kids. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd mentally handle having a child anyway. Depression and anxiety are too prevalent in my life in the way that i can barely look after myself let alone another human being

What's your drunk at work story? ,"This is a long one, so brace yourselves: I used to work in IT application support (besides other things, we were responsible for investigation and hotfixing IT issues of our applications, when necessary). We also worked home office over week days a lot due to some deal of our bosses with business bosses (and the fact that all of the IT of the US based business was being handled from Europe and they wanted IT to cover the time when their people were at work). All of the members of the team were young guys around 25 yo, and we all like to drink and slack sometimes. This one time a friend of mine messaged me ""&lt;placeholder bar&gt;-office today?"". I agreed (not my first time doing this). I got there at 10 pm and was supposed to be working till midnight. I immediately started drinking. Thinking nothing is going to happen anyway so why not to get drunk. At 11:55 pm (11fucking55) I get messaged ""hey man, could you please look into xxx"" and then explaining what he feels is wrong. By this time I already had chugged 10 Jacks with coke (I am a big guy and can chug 20 of them during single night quite easily and still not be hungover the day after). By this point in time I am starting to feel drunk. In the spirit of sending him the fuck away I investigate who to point him to since I am not supposed to be fixing issues like this and none of the people able to help him are online anyway (basically trying to get to get offline). So I investigate while drinking, the most fun I have ever had ""at work"". At approximately 0:30 am I message him that this issue can't be solved today and that the development team will be required (I tried playing the ""its Friday night 00:30 and I have friends drinking in the city"", unsuccessfully), he somehow convinces me to be gathering more info and to investigate a little deeper, so I do. At 01:30 am after chugging my 14th Jack with coke that night I receive a message ""hey, can you please join this conference call?"". I think to myself 'oh fuck, this is bad' and reply ""sure, let me grab my headset"". Good thing the bar we were in was a gaming one, so it had a room with computers, so I asked the bartender if somebody was in (fortunately no) and if I could use it with my laptop (he said yes). I join the conference call. Turns out the guy that initiated me had overreacted and started a conf call with like 5 other businesses people. Immediately after joining I am asked to explain what I found out. I explained what I found out (at this point I thought I was going to get fired) and where the problem is and also that there is no way to fix it today. The attendants did those 'nodding sounds', asked couple of follow up questions and that was it. The guy that got me into this then finished the call with ""hope your friends aren't too drunk by this point"" and I responded with ""I shall catch up"". Then I went back to drinking, came home at 07:00 am. I don't know if the guys on the call had noticed me being drunk AF when talking and just decided to ignore the fact or that they didn't even notice, but this incident was never mentioned to me again and not even to my bosses since we have really friendly atmosphere in the team and they would definitely wanted to ask me about this, if only to make fun of me later. TLDR: got drunk in a pub/bar while at ""home office"", then proceeded to work overtime finished by a conference call where I talked a lot. Incident never mentioned again."
What's your drunk at work story? ,Had a couple beers at lunch and when I arrived back a co-worker greeted me with a bottle of whiskey.

I woke up at 0550 and didn't get the text so I went to PT. Snow sucks when you're drunk."

My best guess is the turn signal sound annoys her, though, which means she doesn't want to risk leaving it on for more than a few seconds if there's not a chance to turn or something."

My husband has ADHD, so I absolutely understand what you're dealing with. I never understood it until I watched him try to leave the house one time right after we'd started dating. It took three trips back to the house, 20 minutes, and two instances of getting distracted by something shiny in the garage before he was finally ready to go. It's frustrating at times. He needs lists and reminders and time buffers to stay on track.. And his meds occasionally have to be adjusted (side note: for some reason when it comes to Adderall, a generic may or may not act the same as the name brand or another generic.

Americans what do you remember doing on 9/11/2001? ,"Woke up to my phone ringing like crazy, so of course, I ignored it until it was time to go to work. I went upstairs to leave and all my roomates were crowded around the tv. I saw the images and figured they were watching a movie. I drove to work still unaware and everyone at work was listening to the news. That's when my coworker told me what was going on. So I was probably the last person to find out as it was 1pm when I first heard. God I miss the days when I could sleep like that."
Americans what do you remember doing on 9/11/2001? ,"I woke up and my parents had it on TV. 2001 was early for streaming video, but I set my laptop up to run a news stream too... and then that stopped working after the first tower fell. It was weird, there was a bunch of internet stuff that started working super-slow, presumably because there were so many people checking every communication source they could get to for information. I had to go out and buy something later that afternoon... I forget what... but even the credit card transaction was unusually slow. I was living in California, so I think maybe I had less fear that something would happen to me... and the only relatives I had on the East Coast at the time were retired and in New Jersey, and as such not likely to have been injured or killed. The atmosphere was strange, though. People were panicked, but there was also a kind of solidarity. Everyone in the country was thinking about the same thing. You could talk to anybody, a random stranger in the street, and know for a fact that they would be preoccupied with exactly the same questions that you were. But there were other things too. In the days and weeks afterward, you overheard people saying a lot of racist stuff. A friend of my dad's whose family came to the US in the 1980s had a car with a vanity license plate that was the name of a major Middle-Eastern city, the place where he'd grown up. Pre-9/11 most people didn't know what it meant and wouldn't have cared if they did, but after... He told my dad that he kept that car in the garage and didn't drive it for a couple of years because he thought people might throw rocks at it or slash the tires if he parked it outside."
Americans what do you remember doing on 9/11/2001? ,No shit. I was thinking the same thing.
Americans what do you remember doing on 9/11/2001? ,not being born yet
Americans what do you remember doing on 9/11/2001? ,"I woke up because the phone was ringing and ringing and ringing and ringing. I decided to ignore it, because I was sleeping. But the phone kept ringing so I got up out of bed grumpily. It was my mom and she asked me, ""What is going on?"" and I was pissy, and I said ""I don't know,"" because I was tired and annoyed about the phone ringing and waking me up and she told me to turn on the news, and she told me that she had just been evacuated from work. So I was like, uh, ok. Then I turned on the news, saw that planes had crashed into the towers and the pentagon and it was a suspected terrorist attack, so I understood why she had been evacuated from work (she worked for a government agency that could have been a terrorist target). So then I stayed glued to the TV watching until I had to get ready for class. My first class started at 12:40. I got to campus, and hardly anyone was there. So, I went to class, and all we talked about was the planes. We didn't get anything done. Then I went to my other class, found out that it had been canceled and so I went home and watched news. Then I went to a prayer service with my mom later in the evening. And we were on the news, because the local news service was doing reports showing people going to prayer services and there we were."

How do you make yourself stick to your new years resolutions? ,"Write out a check to an organization you really hate. It doesn't matter so much what it is, just so long as you would never, ever want your name to be associated with them. Something really reprehensible, from your perspective. The check has to be a large enough amount that it will hurt when it hits your account. Whatever that means to you, make it large enough that you'll have to scramble some to cover it. Put the check in a sealed envelope, addressed to the HQ of that org. You don't have to actually name them on the outside, but you have to honestly address it accurately. Put postage on it so it's ready to go at any moment. Include a letter with your real name and address on it, asking to be considered for membership in that organization. Give the letter to a reliable friend. Tell them that you are going to do whatever it is as your resolution. You're going to stop smoking, or lose twenty pounds, or whatever. Schedule regular meetings with said friend, maybe monthly. At these meetings, discuss your progress toward your resolution. The checkpoints have to be realistic but fair. If you're stopping smoking, for example, maybe you have to taper down to half by March, quit entirely by July, and be smoke-free through the end of the year. Whatever makes sense for you. You have one last meeting at this time a year from now. You honestly assess your progress toward your goal. If you've met your goal, all your friend has to do is give you the letter back. If you've failed, they only have to drop it in the mailbox."

How does an introvert slowly learning to be an extrovert make friends in their 30's? ,"I actually won''t ever do one of those gene services for that reason despite really wanting to satiate my curiosity.

How does an introvert slowly learning to be an extrovert make friends in their 30's? ,"This exactly. The terms introvert and extrovert are used incorrectly most of the time and/or are misunderstood. The terms really refer to what invigorates an individual. Introvert: A person whom mentally and emotionally recharges when in solitude or in one-on-one personal interaction situations. Introverts require their ‚Äúquiet time‚Äù to re-energize themselves. Extrovert: A person who is mentally and emotionally recharged by being in active social situations and being around others. Extroverts require active interaction time with other people to re-energize. Introverts aren‚Äôt necessarily shy; they just get emotionally and mentally drained by social situations (ie. a party) whereas an extrovert in that same situation would be more energized by being with and talking to other people. On the reverse side, extroverts aren‚Äôt necessarily outgoing, but they crave the social interaction to keep themselves mentally healthy. TL,DR: Extroverts thrive on social interaction; introverts are drained by the similar interaction. It‚Äôs all a matter of which type of interaction gets your mind/emotions functioning at peak performance. It‚Äôs not something that typically changes because it‚Äôs a core part of your personality."

"People of Reddit, do you blame your parents for anything? Is so, what and why? ","Seems like this thread is dead, but I want to vent anyway. I blame my parents for in a way ruining my first relationship. His visa allowed him only 4 more months in Australia when we met. He was quite a bit older than me and had a part-time job. Granted all these stuff might seem concerning to some but his great personality completely overshadowed the rest of his problems. He is still the most honest, kindest person I have ever met, and honestly that's what's important really. When my parents found out that we met, they reacted like I'd been murdered. My biological dad made him death threats (seriously.) My step-dad actually agreed to meet him, until my mum decided that it's ""too much to bother"" and I should just get over it. Her reasoning is, if her friend's daughters don't feel the need to date, I shouldn't ""act special"" and ""cause trouble"". They didn't care about my emotions because they were ""stupid"" and I don't ""know better"". Yeah so we still met in secret, but we never got to go on dates like he promised because of time constraints. My parents made sure I couldn't leave home outside of school hours. I often anxiously planned opportunities to meet him, only for my parents to unknowingly do something to ruin my plans. Then I had to pretend that I'm happy when I'm boiling with anger inside. The fear of being caught by my parents made it difficult to enjoy spending time with him outside. When I heard a girl in my school boast about how her parents let her see her boyfriend everyday, I went to the toilet and pathetically cried."

To this day I still don't know what to do, I wasted a year of my life and now another 3 months studying education, gonna hop onto something new, I hope it will do for the time being at least. Oh and also I'm trapped in that guilty ""who will take care of us when we are older"" loop and it seems like I am the only one who can."
"People of Reddit, do you blame your parents for anything? Is so, what and why? ","Their ignorance about growth hormones, making up side effects. I've stopped growing and I'm really, really short."
"People of Reddit, do you blame your parents for anything? Is so, what and why? ","I was undoubtedly a smart mouth growing up, but I feel like I was sent to my room/grounded more than I should have been during middle/high school. I missed a lot of social events because I was always grounded last minute. Thinking back on it, I really think it was because my parents just didn't want to take me places. I feel like I missed out on a lot of social experiences. As an adult, socializing doesn't come easy/is kind of scary. I feel like if my parents had let me do more things while I was younger and less fearful - being social would come more naturally to me now."
A happy new year to all Redditors! What is your new year resolution and how will you actually follow it this time? ,"I usually aim to loose weight.

Each block is blocked off with wood fence stuff and towards the back of each block was not that crowded. It felt really in control. Bathrooms? We paid some cover for the Playwright and we could come and go. We went in, used bathroom, warmed up and went back out. It was cold - but not bad. Like mid 20s I think. Better than cold rain."

Why can‚Äôt extinction of species be prevented by cloning? ,"It can be. But, theres very little genetic diversity meaning the creatures start being deformed"
Why can‚Äôt extinction of species be prevented by cloning? ,"Cloning is a very expensive and extremely difficult way to replicate what creatures generally do naturally for free - make babies. Making new individuals is almost never the difficult bit in keeping a species alive. It‚Äôs usually issues like habitat loss, pollution, loss of food supply, etc. You know - general pressure from humanity. Being able to make new babies in the lab isn‚Äôt going to solve or address any of those issues. When people talk about preserving genetic material for future cloning programs, there‚Äôs an unspoken assumption that at some point in the future, humanity will get its collective shit together and there will once again be room on the earth for other species, so that someday it may make sense to try to reintroduce these species. There will be other massive challenges including the aforementioned lack of genetic diversity, so it remains to be seen if it‚Äôs anything more than a pipe dream, but we won‚Äôt even have that if we fail to preserve the material."
Why can‚Äôt extinction of species be prevented by cloning? ,"You wouldn‚Äôt be really clowning at that point but simulating meiosis. This could theoretically work, but currently the technology is not there and it would probably take a while for it to be practicable as it would probably be expensive. Eventually it could work though."
Why can‚Äôt extinction of species be prevented by cloning? ,Assuming we develop the technology to conserve diversity and clone species. Would it be a viable option to preserve any species?
Why can‚Äôt extinction of species be prevented by cloning? ,"Can't actually live, if there's no place to live. Most extinctions are cause by habitat destruction."

Anyway, now I have the time and the money, but Chinese have bulldozed the old town and turned Lhasa's famous open market square into Tainamen Two, and the shopkeepers are all Han Chinese selling fake Tibetan stuff made in China. So it's gone. Then I was on another mission over there and two Austrailian buddies said, come on, before you leave, you have to see this beach! So I went, then took off on my own from the resort town and found a real remote fishing village, and they let me go fishing with them at dawn in their outright canoes way out in the deep blue sea with rag sails and hook handlines, could not understand a word, but we were racing fast before the wind with big baskets of fresh silver fish, then we went to a temple after, and then I found a spirit Buddha alone deep in the jungle, wow. So cool!!! My friends wrote to tell me the Chinese have bought that coast and it's all tourist hotels now. So it's gone. But I got to live it for a day."

How powerful is Google? ,"It's worse than that: it's the monkeys-with-type-writers hypothesis crossed with a blind faith that their algorithms are smart enough to find the complete works of Shakespeare amongst all the monkey turds, and the arrogance to think that the combined human wisdom of all content creators and editors is worthless and obtainable for free. It somehow goes unnoticed that both Google and Facebook have distinctly pyramid-shaped business models, relying on vast armies of unpaid content creators at the bottom to have anything at all to offer their audiences, and underpaid and unrespected content moderation staff who aren't part of their official staff headcount and have little influence over the product, no matter how bad it gets. Only by attracting a steady stream of new content creators via trumped-up media success stories do they keep growing. That's not a sustainable business model, long-term. When you pay peanuts, you get monkeys, and that's a big part of why so much internet content is crap; they don't pay enough for professional content creators to survive. So everyone has merch, #sponcon, Patreon etc while Google quietly takes &gt;90% of the advertising revenue their content generates and uses it to power their products for free."
How powerful is Google? ,"This is a serious issue. Personalisation algorithms are a dark mirror that reflect your own biases back at you constantly to 'engage' you. At worst, it becomes a radicalization engine that pushes people toward extreme, unhinged viewpoints. If you're 1% more likely to click on a story with the words 'black' and 'crime' in the headline, the algorithms detect that and show you more. The increase in 'black crime' stories registers subconsciously and your mind can easily process it as a genuine increase in 'black crime'. Then you'll likely start clicking on those stories more and go down a confirmation-bias rabbit hole that can result in a kind of assisted self-radicalization. I'm pretty sure there's even worse stuff going on with mental health triggers, though haven't had the time to do comprehensive research yet. Personally, I'm a child sex trafficking survivor with PTSD and I used to be able to mostly leave it in the past. I can't use anything with a personalisation algorithm in it as it detects that I can be super-engaged by finding something that triggers a dissociative episode and I just keep mindlessly clicking on auto-pilot. (""Thousand-yard stare"" is another way this mental state has been described.) For me, anything with a personalisation algorithm is a cesspool of raped and murdered kids and women -- Google, Facebook, YouTube etc -- because that's the most 'engaging' content they can find to target me with. I own a book called ""Evil By Design."" It's not a cautionary tale; it's a manual for my former job. Manipulating humans' behavior and emotions to get as much of their time as possible is not a morally neutral act, but it's business as usual in tech. I've met far too many techbros who thought it would be kinda cool to grow up to be evil supervillains... and with billions of dollars and minds at their disposal, some of them aren't far from it now.

"British people of Reddit: How much, if anything, did you learn about the American Revolution in school? ","There was discontent about tea. As a British person, I can relate. It's an important subject. Really, nothing much. Covered the industrial revolution and the world wars. Later on learned about British imperialism, which seemed to be a mix of rapacious greed and bringing religion to the heathens. So not all that surprised the Americans revolted."
"British people of Reddit: How much, if anything, did you learn about the American Revolution in school? ","I think it falls more towards the second one, it was always touted as such an important, monumental event to me that it was strange to me to find out it wasn't even mentioned at all for them. but also i realize that the US has a lot less history, we basically go decade by decade in our classes so we mention all of the wars the US has ever been in and that kind of thing, which you can't do with british history.

"British people of Reddit: How much, if anything, did you learn about the American Revolution in school?

People in each country tend to learn (relatively) a lot about the foundational events in their own country's history. 2. The American Revolution isn't an important foundational event of UK history.

How old were you before you could go to sleep with all the lights off? ,"Can't remember exactly but have never needed a night light. When I was younger we had street lights outside our house and maybe that was enough, but when I was 6, we moved to a street without them. For the first year or so, we kept the outside lights on but stopped because that attracted thousands of millipedes. Usually the light in the lounge would still be on when I fell asleep, so it wouldn't be pitch black in the house. By the time it was, I'd already have been asleep. And by the time I stayed awake later than that, I didn't care that it was dark. As an adult, it has to be almost complete darkness for me to sleep, and I figure that If I can't see what's in the dark, then there's a good chance it cant see me."

Why isn't there an 18+ age requirement to be famous? It can ruin a childhood right? ,"You're basically asking the government to control which people the public has knowledge of, which seems ridiculously unenforceable. Are we supposed to have mass memory wipes because too many people saw a video and the kid was underage? Not only that, but it isn't fame that destroys lives of famous children. Fame is just being known about by a large number of people, and nothing about that is inherently bad. &gt;""Ooohh nooo you can't know who that child is, they're too young to be known about by a large number of people."" What really ruins lives is being in a line of work that makes them famous **and is also extremely high stress.** Yeah I get that it's just a utopian thought and everyone knows it's impossible to enforce, but I think it's still a pointless thought. You might as well have suggested that all governments should just start being nice to each other. Like what's the point of bringing it up."
Why isn't there an 18+ age requirement to be famous? It can ruin a childhood right? ,"And as the rules are now, babies on TV and in movies are generally premies, with twins and triplets preferred. These babies are more likely to get sick, but by the time they look like little babies, they are old enough to work longer hours, plus twins/triplets are able to work two or three shifts per day because there are more of them in one role. It's hard to make a system that can't be gamed."
Why isn't there an 18+ age requirement to be famous? It can ruin a childhood right? ,That would be impossible to enforce as famous just means to be known and it isn't like someone can attain it like alcohol and thus be limited.

Why isn't there an 18+ age requirement to be famous? It can ruin a childhood right? ,It‚Äôs not really possible to put a restriction on that without seriously restricting large amount of freedoms from the child

The two older looking admitting doctors who were taking blood pressure and info and that kind of thing kept looking at me in the back of the line and finally called me to the front of the line because I looked so bad. (I'm thinking... WTF.... Sinus infection...) The took my information, then hooked me up to the BP machine. I've never seen a horrified look on a Dr.s face before, he tapped his partner and his partner looked over, his eyes got HUGE and he said ""Take it again"", 265/154 blood pressure. They got me in the back away from the crowd and started hooking me up to IV's and all sorts of monitors and other fun stuff. Spent a week in the hospital being tested like... hourly.

"People who have almost died, what is your story? ",&gt;Holy shit
"People who have almost died, what is your story? ",Misdiagnosed diabetic and went into Ketoacidosis. Went to ER and can only remember bits and pieces. Remember waking up sometime later all groggy with a bunch of people around me.
"People who have almost died, what is your story? ","I have two I want to share, the first happened to me when I was about 15/16 at my friend's house, and is probably more my own fault than anything else. So I was in the kitchen having just made a sandwich, meanwhile she went to the toilet (the house was set up so the toilet was the room next door to the kitchen, so she could still hear me). Anyway, I grab a bite of my sandwich and there's a big piece of ham in there, I didn't chew it properly, so after I swallow I started to choke. I'm stood by myself choking in my friends kitchen; I realised very quickly that if I didn't do something I'd die (I already felt dizzy and I remember my vision was going fuzzy, I could feel all the heat from the blood in my face but remember feeling like my lips were really cold) so I learnt over the counter, wrapped my arms around my stomach and started trying to thrust upwards with my fist, punching my stomach to try and wretch it up, anything at all that I thought could help. I can't describe my feeling of relief when I finally got it up, I remember I took a huge break and fell to the floor. When my friend came into the kitchen she asked what all the noise was about, I told her what had just happened but she didn't believe me that I actually could have died, she just laughed :3 TLDR: Was in my friends kitchen, nearly choked on food, had to Heimlich maneuver myself, friend laughed her ass off. The second happened a few days ago (NYE) My bf and I were on our way to the supermarket and there's a two way junction to get into it (so if the supermarket is on your right, there's a lane to go straight and another to go right, and the other side of traffic mirrors this). So he takes a right to get to the store just as an oncoming motorcycle flies straight past him. My bf saw him at the last minute and stopped, but I remember thinking how odd it was we'd been through the whole year with no incidents, but on the last day was the one that nearly killed us. TLDR: Nearly hit a motorcyclist off his bike on NYE"
"People who have almost died, what is your story? ",Very cool! Thank you Kanye
"People who have almost died, what is your story? ","The last nine years there were several times I almost died because of anaphylactic reactions. Since 2010 I have a severe latex allergy which causes multiple cross food allergies as well (tropical fruits, nuts, gluten, etc.). This latex allergy has become airborne, so when I‚Äôm in a room with an object of latex I can go into an anaphylactic shock. The presence of gloves or balloons is catastrophic. Because of a poor health I have to visit hospitals very often. In my country there is almost no latex awareness, so instead of curing me, I almost died there several times because of the use of latex."

What are some tell-tale signs that your partner is lying? ,"When you ask an innocuous question and they quickly change the subject or give way too much pointless detail that they've rehearsed in their mind while not making eye-contact. The fact is that some people are really good at lying and some aren't. Some people just don't have the 'tells' that others show easily. However, if someone lies a lot they'll always contradict themselves eventually. My ex-wife was cheating and I had my suspicions for quite a while but she always had a story. She'd put a lot of work into her story before any 'weekend teambuilding' or any of her upcoming events that were basically not true. I suspected but it was difficult to really confront her about it because it was all kinda reasonable at the same time and it's just not always easy to accuse someone of cheating on you. I could have been wrong and it's just not my style to rock the boat like that. She got lazy though and said she was going to stay at her parents for the night and will meet me the next day at about 11 so early the next day I took the subway to near where her parents live. When she messaged saying 'I'm leaving now' I replied that I'm in the neighborhood and we can meet by the subway and get lunch. That was basically it, if she was telling the truth it wouldn't have been a problem but she was nowhere near her parent's house at the time. When we caught up she made an excuse that she'd actually been helping her friend redecorate his apartment but nothing was going on and to watch her saying this was just ridiculous and a bit sad and she knew it."

What were you doing on 9/11? ,Sitting in my apartment getting ready for work. How about you?
What were you doing on 9/11? ,I was at school in 5th Grade. The teachers did not tell us anything but we could kind of sense something was up when they suddenly shut down the library and the teachers started acting kind of off. What we figured out later on was they had a tv on in the library and closed it to the the students so we would not see it. I went to an after school program and again they did not tell us anything and I ended up finding out about the attacks when I got home and went to watch something on TV and could not watch it because it was preempted by the breaking news coverage. I‚Äôll never forget how it was being aired on every channel except for the cartoon channels.
What were you doing on 9/11? ,"Golfing at Myrtle Beach. We felt fucking helpless. We wanted to come home to be with our families. Three of our foursome were in the military (two marines and an airman), and wanted to fight for our country RIGHT NOW. We thought we were engaged in a war."

Why Is United States Federal Government Always Shut Down? ,"This is a result of the Republican policy of ""our way or nothing,"" which they adopted in the early 2000s. Younger readers might find it hard to picture, but Congress used to actually do stuff. As late as the 1990s, Republicans and Democrats would stand on the floor of Congress all day impugning each others' ancestries for the cameras, but after hours, they'd quietly get together over drinks and horse-trade, so stuff got done. They compromised. There were even quite a few genuine cross-party friendships in the government, people who respectfully disagreed with each others' opinions, but were still good friends. The increasingly far-right movement of the conservatives in the early 2000s put an end to that."

Slowly days started having color again, I noticed things tasting nice and actually feeling loved by people. Speaking from experience, it does get better, it just takes time."
"Previously depressed and/or suicidal redditors, what helped you get through it? How has your view on life changed? [Serious] ","Hi there. I'm chronically depressed, and diagnosed with Stress Adjustment Disorder (yes, i do call it SAD). I also have ADHD, so I've got a nice trifecta of shit that fucks with your head. All of it came to a head one day when I woke up in a mental hospital and was told I tried to get run over by a car. I'm gonna lay down my experience, and you folks can take from it what you want. I'm not gonna be PC, or sugar coat it, so if that's not your thing, ignore below. * I'll start this off right now, those thoughts in your head, they will never go away. You can live for 100 more years and those terrible, downputting things floating in your head never disappear. The only thing they do is become louder or softer. Sometimes that voice is so soft you don't hear it, other times it's deafening. But the only way you will ever have control over the volume is your dedication to proving them wrong. Take a step back, silence your brain, and use cold logic to discern the truth of the situation. I guarantee you there is nothing in your life worth killing yourself over or worrying yourself into pieces over. You and I both know you've fucked up in life. You are not special there. Even in the most unique of situations you still share a common thread of fucking up somewhere in life. The difference is whether you decide to stand up and move forward, or wallow in the fact you failed. And the more you move forward, you'll find the quieter those voices become. *Go fucking talk about it. I dont care how much of a shut in, lonely, introverted, anxious person you are, go find someone to talk to about it. You have family, friends, neighbors, hotlines, pastors, rabbis, witch doctors, and therapists with ears, go see if you can talk them off. Stewing in your own thoughts alone does nothing but make you the world's worst sounding board. Your mind is already compromised with twisted mindsets, go get a fresh perspective. ""But what if they just tell me to suck it up or something?"" Fuck 'em then. They weren't good people anyways. * And you, reading this and wanting to kill themselves. Don't You fucking dare. Without even getting to you, you are costing dozens of people thousands of dollars and weeks of their time just by becoming a corpse. And trust me, that suicide note will never, EVER answer the questions your loved ones will have. That is a lifetime of turmoil you're pushing on them just because you wanna take the easy way out. Don't be a selfish prick, put your mistake of choice down, and go to a hospital. Go to the desk, and tell them, ""Hi, my name is XXXXXX, and I am having suicidal thoughts. I would like somewhere safe to stay where I will not harm myself."" They're gonna ask you questions, and if they have a mental ward, take you there. If not, they'll have you wait with someone while they look up the nearest available place that can take you. It is not like the movies at all. You might wear hospital clothes, you might even get to wear your own clothes after a bit. Food is gonna be mediocre, but ive also been suprised at some good stuff. It will be boring, calm, and very scheduled for you. You're gonna have as much time as you need to figure your shit out, with people trained to help you get there. It is going to be alright. Finishing off, the most important part: IT WILL GET BETTER. Yeah it's overused, but you know why? Because it's fucking true! Everything in life is temporary, so it becomes far more important to focus your efforts on moving into the future, not worrying about the past, not panicking over your present. Get better. I know you will. I'm a lazy, selfish, conceited, foul mouthed prick with no esteem, and no redeeming qualities. I'm the bottom of the fucking barrel. If I can get past it, anyone can."
"Previously depressed and/or suicidal redditors, what helped you get through it? How has your view on life changed? [Serious] ",Teachings of a Buddha.... made me realize my problems aren‚Äôt really problems at all.
"Previously depressed and/or suicidal redditors, what helped you get through it? How has your view on life changed? [Serious] ","Long answer short; The love from others changed my mind and that is how I cope. Make sure everyone you love knows, you never know you may save them. Long answer long: I never made an attempt but was contemplating. However at this time my uncle (who I had only met too young to remember as he lived too far away) who had been missing for 6 months was found hanging in his bedroom (for some legal reasons they couldn't break his door down for that long). He seemed to have a good life before committing suicide.We suspect it was due to his time in the army which caused him to do such a thing. When my mum found out she was devistated. She took weeks off work just cause she couldn't function properly. Every moment of silence she would tear up and if no-one was around she'd break down into a flow of tears. After I saw this I knew I couldn't do it. There was no way I could make this worse. I then got past my hardship and forgot all about suicide. Untill last year when another spate of depression led me to similar thoughts once more. However what got me out of it this time was that my mum's phone broke and she thought all her contacts were lost. On the most part it was no issue but then she remembered that that also meant my uncles number was gone. She cried just like she did at the time he was found, luckily we managed to regain her contacts. This time it hit me harder than the last as I now saw it wasn't short term pain but very much life long. And once again couldn't do it. And after witnessing that I never will as I know I'll always have someone that loves me too much to do so. And to reiterate this feeling about a month ago my grandad called her starting by saying her brother called him. She for an instant thought it was somehow the one that had died and upon the realisation it wasn't broke down again."
"Previously depressed and/or suicidal redditors, what helped you get through it? How has your view on life changed? [Serious] ","I was depressed because of my life situation at the time. I was with someone very mean and bad for me. In order to get better, I left. For people with depression that comes from the inside, this doesn't work. But if it's coming from your life situation, you are the ONLY one who can stop it. No one else will care like you do, you have to take control and if you can't, you have to find resources to help you. After I left it was night and day. I have never felt depressed again. Sad at times, but never depressed. It's been about 15 years."

What is often associated with being an introvert that shouldn't be? ,"Social anxiety or not being able to talk to people in general. People think that introversion is synonymous with being socially awkward or that you don't like to be around people. It annoys me how people misunderstand this. It literally has nothing to do with social skill and I hate the fact that, as an introverted person, when I want to be alone, people think it's an unhealthy behavior. That I'm giving into my anxiety. No, I just want to be alone after spending days with family bustling around the house."

"If one day to another, the concept of profit and gains would be erased from peoples minds and from the world. What would, or possibly what could change? ","On a very literal level, everything would change. Gains/profits stems from the more important idea that investing harvests results; not just monetarily. This is the same idea as spending time to learn something new so that you can use it in the future. Investing effort in yourself and others for healthier relationships. It's all from the same idea that small changes accumulate over time and can be very beneficial. This is evolution, it's progress, it's understanding. If we understand this idea applies in other places, it would be absurdity for us to not apply it to money. It's a good idea that is sometimes abused."

Honestly she sounded like a harpy and it made me look at my own behavior. I read books about parenting and started learning to parent without yelling at my kids. I don't let my girls run wild, I just don't generally raise my voice anymore and it's proved to be far more effective that constant yelling."

I would also like to point out I am not the one who made this about masturbation, lol. But I'll definitely give your method a try. Happy new year!"
[Serious] I broke my dominant hand. What are some fun activities to do with only one hand? ,"It is possible. It's easier to do one handed if you're stimulating someone else. But with a bit of positioning, it can still be done. Get a pillow under your hips, maybe two if your bed (or other surface) is unusually soft. The key is to have your hips higher than your shoulders. This allows the middle and ring or index finger to reach the g-spot and let the base of the palm rest on the clitoris. The motion can be awkward at first because you have to curl your fingers, thrust, and roll your palm across the clitoris at the same time. Your hips need to be elevated because it puts your pelvis at the right angle to present the vaginal opening at the same angle as the palm. It also lets you curve your abdomen without having to engage the abs as much. Gives you more time to work. This can be modified if you have a partner stimulating you from behind. You'll just need to handle the angle by muscle effort. Of course, this only works well if broad clitoral stimulation works for you. Everyone is different, and some need more precise targeting of the clit to get there. But it's worth a try."

What's a wonderful thought or fact to start the new year with? ,"A bit late on the response (sorry), but while you're right that the time spent could've been used better toward more productive hobbies, I'm also going to disagree on the idea that it wasn't spent well. All that time spent is a very special part of my life. Even ignoring that, I've been very close to the world of gaming since I was little. TF2 may hold the most hours but I've sunk so many hours into other games as well and in general. The world and creative art of gaming is my life and has been, since day 1, an experience and feeling that I am going to give back to someone one way or another. I am currently studying 3D animation with the plan of using said skills that I will in time gain to give that experience to others. For a long time, I always wanted to be the guy with his vision seen in the form of video games, but I also love animation of various kinds and this is where I have settled for the time being. Trust me, gaming isn't just escapism. I'm here to make something of it."

What's a wonderful thought or fact to start the new year with? ,"Yeah man it's definitely not easy. With that said, there's no going back and doing the past better, only the decisions you make in the future. Depression can be an awful mental trap sometimes, getting you to think about the wrong things and killing your will/energy/desire to do the right things tomorrow. But, something being difficult doesn't mean it's impossible...in fact, sometimes things being difficult mean they're worth doing!"
What's a wonderful thought or fact to start the new year with? ,Ya know that's an easy phrase to drop and surely true but depression tries to tell you otherwise. Always getting you to focus on what you fckd up instead of what you can accomplish. I'm trying really hard nevertheless though.
What's a wonderful thought or fact to start the new year with? ,"In my experience being kind to other people has led to forming wonderful friendships, interesting opportunities with work and a strong familly life.

What is your worst NYE story? ,I was just coming out of a divorce and I drank everything. The emotions and hangover were incredible.
What is your worst NYE story? ,Yes.
What is your worst NYE story? ,"The only time I have ever thrown up after. Whenever I get drunk, if I'm gonna throw up its before I go to bed. I never throw up after. Except one New Years Day. Throwing up bile is.. extremely unpleasant. And it does nothing towards a hangover. I'd rather think about what a failure I am in the comfort of a bed than hunched over a toilet bowl. But maybe that situation, the toilet bowl, has more impact. ""I'll never do this again!"" I wouldn't know. Nausea is rarely a symptom of my hangovers. Sure I get an uneasy stomach that does not succumb to brunch, but I never think I'm gonna puke. I'm in my mid 30s.. and I drink. But I never throw up the next day. I would easily trade the anxiety and depression that comes with hangovers.. if I could just puke it up."
What is your worst NYE story? ,"I just told this story a few days ago in another thread, but here it is again... &gt;Nearly 18 years ago on New Years eve, my friends and I were all tripping on shrooms, when one suddenly had the great idea to call up a friend of his that he knew I liked and invite her over. &gt;She said sure if she could bring her friend (I believe not knowing we were tripping), and I was already thinking about nyoping out considering I was pretty damned high and didnt want to make an idiot of myself in front of her. &gt;So we took a walk-about to meet her half way... Which ended up being right in front of a police station (bad enough)... Then as we got closer, we realized it wasn't her, but her underage 15 year old sister (WTFFuuuuu), and 14 year old friend ... who my buddy was actually talking to on the phone without realizing. &gt;NOPE! I kept walking right to the train station and went home. &gt;On the plus side, I did end up getting together with the girl I liked, and we've been married 15 years. Her sister still insists my friend knew it was actually her on the phone, and honestly it wouldn't surprise me, dude was a perv. Now what I didn't mention in that thread, was the train ride home. You ever have a bad mushroom trip? Now imagine that while being stuck in a sardine can like train full of drunken revellers while one guy keeps eying you up and you're pretty sure it's because he wants to murder and rob you, and then you vomit and it gets on several other passengers, and you get off before your stop for fear of the cops picking you up and have to walk another 10 km's home. Fun times."

"Drug users of reddit, have you ever taken LSD and experienced a second trip after the initial one? What happened? ","Yes. Only after smoking some marijuana though. It briefly extended the trip by about 3-4 hours. But LSD is nothing like what you see portrayed in the movies. All it really does is make colors very neat, allow a lot of self reflection as time ceases to exist (perceptually, obviously it's still moving forward) and amplifies your emotional state (if you are in a good head space going into the trip, that will be amplified, and the opposite is true). It is legitimately something I think every single human should experience at least once in their life."

What is the most wholesome crime you've ever committed? ,"When I was a teenager I worked at a drugstore in an area where 90% of customers were rich housewives AKA disgusting brats. Any time someone was pleasant to me, I'd knock a few dollars off their transaction without telling them. It happened so little that the amount was negligible."
What is the most wholesome crime you've ever committed? ,"During a roadtrip through the middle of New York State we stopped at a rest area to grab a potty and some drinks. The vending machine, we punched in A1 to get a Gatorade, the Gatorade dropped and then it refunded the $1.00. Confused, we put the dollar back in and hit A1 to get another Gatorade, but it said ""sold out,"" even though there was still a Gatorade in the slot. What we deduced was that the little laser sensor thing at the bottom was broken, so the machine saw us up in a dollar, hit A1, the A1 activated, but it didn't sense anything dispensed, so it flagged A1 as empty and refunded the dollar. So put kept feeding that dollar and hit A2, A3, A4, A5, B1, B2, B3.... I think we grabbed about 8 free drinks before we stopped. It wasn't until much later, thinking back about the story, that I realize this was legit stealing. At the time we just thought Monopoly-style "" vending machine error in your favor, collect 8 Gatorade."""
What is the most wholesome crime you've ever committed? ,"&gt; Customers all had a PIN assigned that we could see on the account, There are not enough frowny face emojis to convey how unhappy I am with this sentence."
What is the most wholesome crime you've ever committed? ,"Buckle up, long post coming. Not exactly a crime, but... I used to work as a technician for cellphone company. We had a little service desk in the back of the store, a reasonably long walk from the front door of our establishment. One winter, an elderly woman with a cane came in. She headed directly for me at the tech counter, although she was showing obvious discomfort while walking, and was (I assumed) in a good amount of pain. She got to my counter, and I talked through her phone issue with her. As it turned out, one of the services I had to perform to fix her phone required access to her customer account. In-store, this required her to show me a valid photo ID to prove her identity before I could do this and fix her phone. So I ask for her ID, and she looks totally dismayed...it's all the way out in her car, she informs me, and she'd have to go out and get it from her purse. Obviously, this meant another long painful walk there, and painful walk back. As she turns to start her journey, my empathy overloads my rule-following, and I stop her, and ask her to verify the PIN number on her account. Customers all had a PIN assigned that we could see on the account, which we could freely use to verify them over the phone, but we were NOT allowed to use this in store. Seeming relieved, she supplied the PIN, and I fixed her phone and sent her on her way. No sooner was she gone, than I was immediately hauled aside by the Sales Manager who chewed me out and told me he'd fire me if I ever did that again. I explained my reasons, and he said he knew why since he'd observed the whole situation. Regardless, I wasn't sorry."

"People of Reddit, what are some oddly specific fears that you have? ","I have an oddly specific fear of being stuck in the ground headfirst from only my arms length down.

You're obviously quite young then, and yes it is an acquired taste, we all think it tastes like shit to begin with.

This time, 20 years ago I was laying in a pool of my own puke having downed 3 large wine glasses of Jack Daniel's. I can't touch the stuff to this day.

"What‚Äôs worse, corporate or government control? ","If a corporation comes to completely control a society, hasn't that corporation essentially become a governmentü§î?"
"What‚Äôs worse, corporate or government control? ","You are confusing corporate influence on government with free-market policies. Corporate control of the government is still corporate control. Go check out your city government and tell me how much they care about making more money. Everything I've ever seen on the local level is just about ensuring people are educated, healthy, and safe. And sometimes selfish behavior like cronyism, nepotism, and outright greed. The underlying assumption in capitalism is that people are free to make their own choices to do what is best for them, so government only needs to make some ground rules."
"What‚Äôs worse, corporate or government control? ",A corporately bought and sold government.
"What‚Äôs worse, corporate or government control? ","I like and agree with that. I think to add to what you say, but from another angle, is that if a country with a relatively good government that honors laws gets into a civil war or any war at all for that matter, states or provinces could possibly secede and the government itself is broken down during conflict and when the land is at its weakest another powerful entity emerges."

What are some careers that are more difficult but has an average or same pay as others? ,"&gt; upwards of like $150k to become a commercial pilot, not to mention the some 3k hours or something needed to start flying the small planes ok, Depending on where you are, thats utter BS they fed you (unless your in Europe and Ok, Maybe they had something with the cost). For example in the US, to get a Commercial Pilots Certificate (Which isn't what you think it is), its 250 Hours and cost around (including the previous two ratings + Hour building) $30-35k. To get to the Highest level, Air Transport Pilot (What a ""Commercial Pilot"" is), takes 1500 hours and probably cost all in all with all ratings 40k. Most pilots by the time they get there are flight instructors and building time on someone elses dime so its less cost that way."
What are some careers that are more difficult but has an average or same pay as others? ,"Nursing. At one end you have CNAs, who have to become state certified &amp; attend classes for a few weeks to get a job that usually pays barely above minimum wage. Then at the other, you have RNs, who go to college &amp; acquire the debt so they can be paid a decent amount to literally keep people alive. Then if they ever owe taxes, the government will take that hard earned nursing license hostage till you pay. And now you have to pay back taxes without a job. Makes perfect sense"
What are some careers that are more difficult but has an average or same pay as others? ,"\[I'm not one but my neighbor is\] &amp;#x200B; so far what ive heard is it's super expensive to become a pilot, and you only start earning good money after having worked for a long time. &amp;#x200B; upwards of like $150k to become a commercial pilot, not to mention the some 3k hours or something needed to start flying the small planes"
What are some careers that are more difficult but has an average or same pay as others? ,Architecture requires an absurd amount of education and qualifications compared to salary. The requirements for practice and certification are on par with lawyers and maybe doctors and the pay is just barely over average.

It work for the first 2 but the 3rd only shot up about 10 feet. Luckily we were 20 feet way. The 4th one did the same, but I only did that because he was going to throw it in the garbage. The fuse had a wrapper around the tip. I can only imagine if that thing would have gone off accidentally."
"Hey Reddit, what is your fireworks story? ","Once on July 4th, some friends and I were setting off rockets into a bay behind the local big chain supermarket. Suddenly a cop car pulls up and two cops get out. With flashlights on us, they asked what we were doing. When we told them they laughed and asked if they could join. One of the cops then went back to the car, grabbed a few of the fireworks they had confiscated from throughout the night, and they both started setting them off. We then just went our separate ways."

[Serious] Whats the best advice you can give someone struggling with loneliness or depression? ,"It gets better. Sounds cliche, but it really does. Tough times pass, even though they seem like they won't. I came really close to doing something dumb a few times as a young person, and I am so grateful I didn't. I have had such a good life in the years since, even though that felt completely remote or impossible at the time. Hang in there, the ride is well worth it."
[Serious] Whats the best advice you can give someone struggling with loneliness or depression? ,"This is not your fault. You are not the only one. Many people even some who may be closer to you than you think may be dealing or have dealt with loneliness or depression. By talking about it to a trusted people, you already begin to remove its power if it becomes overwhelming. Don't let it get to that point, begin as soon as possible. Everything will be okay, many people you don't even think about or know are thinking of you, care about you and want the best for you.

[Serious] Whats the best advice you can give someone struggling with loneliness or depression? ,"That's correct about trying to become motivated. I can relate very well to what you said too. Yes, even by some small miracle a person who just gets out of the chair and walks a block to the mailbox and back should consider that an accomplishment - and it feels really good."
[Serious] Whats the best advice you can give someone struggling with loneliness or depression? ,"What are you good at? What do you enjoy? How old are you? My advice is to step outside yourself. If you have your summers free, work at a summer camp. You don't have to work with the kids if you don't want to, you could work in the kitchen or maintenance or with the animals. But you would have a ready-made group of comrades and you would be outside and it could change your life. I have seen camp save lives. You don't have to know everything ahead of time, they teach you. But if you try, if you put in some effort, pick the right place, it could be amazing."

"This will be your last or first post of the year on Reddit, what's something you want the world to know but are too afraid of sharing with people in your life? ","This is such a self-defeating thought. There are countless posts on social media, commercials, etc. of people reaching out and saying, ""if you are sad, depressed, suicidal, please reach out to me."" I have to believe that there is at least someone who will listen to your very valid feelings. The initial contact is not a bother. Yes, there is such a thing as caretaker burnout, but that doesn't mean that reaching out for help is a bother. Reach out to someone for help if you are feeling depressed or suicidal. Or even just sad. Then take the steps to help yourself through their support. You have air in your lungs and your heart is still beating. That means you can still live and experience life. So live it, by whatever means, especially if it means reaching out for help."

Sometimes, stress can be unavoidable at university: assessments can do your head in, and people can get right under your skin especially around exam time. So, when you can- take time for yourself. I'm currently studying my Masters, and I find that even a 20 minutes break when things get a little too much can be incredibly helpful. Make sure that your time is structured as well, and as much as you can start assessments earlier rather than later and engage with class and fellow students."

You can contribute to a Traditional IRA for the previous tax year up until April 15th. A few years ago I was confused why I ended up owing $800. I'd never gotten less than a $200 refund. I found out I had taken a tax credit that I ended up earning over the limit for and they wanted it back since I didn't qualify. So I opened a Traditional IRA, calculated how much less money I needed to make to qualify again, contributed that amount, and re-qualified for the credit again."

"Did you go to your high school prom? If not, do you regret not going? If you did, what was your experience like and was it actually worth going to? ","I did, my group and date and I got there late because our limo driver not only got lost but ran out of gas so the guys in the car had to help the driver get to the gas station that was super close while my friend steered. When we got to prom, it was about 45 minutes to almost an hour before it was over so we kinda missed the ‚Äòfun stuff‚Äô. Our prom pics...don‚Äôt even ask. The good food was all gone, luckily our group ate Jack in the Box before we got there. I have Epilepsy (seizures) and the building that held all the dancing had strobe lights, so I couldn‚Äôt go dancing and they had already finished up the slow dances so my group and I just chilled outside and played foosball till the dance was over and our limo driver picked us up an hour later. I honestly didn‚Äôt have any fun, and I felt horrible because my group could‚Äôve gone dancing and had fun but they stayed by my side instead. BUT we did go mini golfing the next day which was actually super fun."
"Did you go to your high school prom? If not, do you regret not going? If you did, what was your experience like and was it actually worth going to? ",Nope. I hated high school. HATED.

Is inflation rising faster than the growth of the median American income? Why? ,Yes. Due to a series of economic engines diverting earnings upward to a very small group of people.

Or did you think the trade in value went up out of the goodness of their hearts?

How can you make people stop disrespecting you just because you're not conventionally attractive? ,"Also, regardless of if anyone antagonizing you in this thread is right, it‚Äôs tactless and ironically... disrespectful."
How can you make people stop disrespecting you just because you're not conventionally attractive? ,"Not sure why everyone came to this thread with a stick up their asses, but you‚Äôre completely in the right. I was conventionally ugly for most of my life, now that I‚Äôm a youngs adult I‚Äôve done a 180 and am super conventionally attractive. The amount of respect I recieve from every stranger I interact with is gross. I‚Äôve been a black sheep socially and have always been super quirky but now that I‚Äôm pretty nobody seems to mind. It‚Äôs fucking garbage. Other than taking care of your skin and hair, being friendly always helps. Some people are always gonna blow you off or be rude, and you can‚Äôt get caught up in that. Just be nice to everybody and go with the flow as much as possible, vocalize healthy, good ideas and do whatever you have to to calm your nerves. When you‚Äôre cool, collected, friendly and genuinely try to help others, that will gain you respect. Being yourself and not giving a fuck about what other people are doing is also great for respect. Best of luck."
How can you make people stop disrespecting you just because you're not conventionally attractive? ,"Keep in mind that the insult ‚Äúur ugly‚Äù is the most over used insult of all time on the internet. You can‚Äôt trust it when someone says you‚Äôre ugly because of course people will say that. This is the internet. I guess that means people who say you‚Äôre attractive could be lying too, but there‚Äôs wayyyy less motivation for someone to ‚Äútroll‚Äù by calling someone attractive. The reason you don‚Äôt get attention isn‚Äôt because of your looks tho. Your face is feminine, symmetrical, and none of your features are disfigured or improperly proportioned, you have a nice skin tone, you are an optimal weight. The reason you don‚Äôt get attention might be because you don‚Äôt put yourself in the situation to get attention. If you don‚Äôt go to places where people hit on other people, you won‚Äôt get hit on. People don‚Äôt usually flirt at the grocery store, they flirt at clubs and stuff. It‚Äôs all about the vibe you put out. If you have resting bitch face, people will think you are standoffish. No one wants to get rejected. If you look like you are going to reject someone they won‚Äôt pay attention to you. Not saying you look like you will reject someone or that you have resting bitch face, I‚Äôm just bringing up the possibility of your attitude, posture, aura, what have you, being the issue. You also might not get attention because you look very young. If you are surrounded by people over 18, they won‚Äôt pay attention to someone who looks younger than 18. And you kind of look younger than 18 to me. That being said, you seem to be unaware of your appearance and under misconceptions about how you look. You should try to get therapy or something. Body dysmorphic disorder is a psychological condition that involves the sufferer being unable to truly ‚Äúsee‚Äù themselves as how they actually exist in reality. There are a plethora of reasons for you not receiving attention, most of them related to social cues and how you present yourself attitude wise. Even ugly women get attention. Have you ever seen an ugly woman with a boyfriend? Probably. They go to clubs and put themselves out there to hit on and be hit on. They are approachable in a social context. So even if you were ugly, you would still get attention. But your not and you don‚Äôt because something else is at play besides your looks."
How can you make people stop disrespecting you just because you're not conventionally attractive? ,"I'm going to have to shut this one down too. I honestly don't know the difference between what I look like in my pictures and what I look like in real life. But there has to be a difference because in real life, nobody pays attention to me and everyone ignores me even though I'm nice. And in school, i was bullied so much. But on the internet, its a whole different situation. When i livestream, i get called ugly. But with my pictures and youtube videos, people on the internet say I'm pretty. So there has to be a difference. I observe how pretty girls get treated. And I obverse how i get treated. Big difference."
How can you make people stop disrespecting you just because you're not conventionally attractive? ,"Just scrolled through your account and you are conventionally attractive by most standards. The people disrespecting you either have beef with you because they know you and hate you for some reason, or you exude an attitude that makes people dislike you and want to disrespect you."
How badass would a Beto O-Rourke / Stacey Abrams 2020 ticket be? ,"Honestly, people pushing for Beto and Kamala are the political equivalent of ‚Äòfilthy casuals‚Äô in my opinion. Knowing their records should be an instant deal-breaker for anyone with a good head on their shoulders. The only way we are going to win in 2020 is to run on policy substance that the majority of Americans agree with. Political (or in some cases, actual) celebrities, name recognition, empty platitudes, and anti-Trump rhetoric will only result in Trump (if he‚Äôs not impeached) winning a second term, or Pence (if Trump IS impeached) winning the election. And that‚Äôs all Harris and O‚ÄôRourke have."
How badass would a Beto O-Rourke / Stacey Abrams 2020 ticket be? ,"Honestly, it‚Äôs a matter of who is actually running. The BEST of those who announced would be Warren, but I have some rather large issues with her. Honestly, I‚Äôd love to see Tulsi Gabbard run. While I don‚Äôt agree on all her positions, she is a progressive with sensible positions (such as that we need to cut off Saudi Arabia and other regimes from our money and arms as long as they support terrorists.) And while I care solely about policy, you can‚Äôt deny that a woman, Combat Veteran meets the DNC‚Äôs ‚ÄòDiversity‚Äô standards."

Beto is a bleeding heart liberal compared to Ted Cruz down in Texas, but he‚Äôs center-right in terms of the rest of the country. He votes to deregulate banks and Wall St, was in favor of TPP, is against a Medicare-For-All system...basically, his voting record is a deal-breaker."

What‚Äôs the weirdest reason you‚Äôve had a flight delayed/cancelled? ,"The plane needed a part.

Then delayed again. Then cancelled. With no offer to help us find a hotel or accommodations, due to their plane needing a part.

What are some remedies for an upset stomach? ,"Ginger is an anti-emetic. That's why gingerale is common for a tummy ache. But the cause is important. If it's alcohol related I suggest drinking 2 bottles of water then puking. Then a third. Then puke again. Because you won't beat it, just hold off the inevetable for a little while. If it's like me today, I had food poisoning for new years, I drank a small amount of ginger ale throughout the day but mostly ice cold water. Follow with plain bowtie noodles and some with a bit of beef flavor this afternoon. Unchewed. It's extra work to digest but if you lose your cookies they come up better that way I think."

"Redditors who are into bdsm how did you know, and how did it start? ","I found out through dating submissive girls who asked me to tie them up and roll play. I always knew I like to dominate. But not to that level. I really got into it when a girl I was with liked to be choked and slammed around on top of your BDSM stuff. Now I'm the kind of guy who likes to be in control but on the side that I like getting women off. Even when they've begged me to stop because it's too much. The old line of I get off when they do. I found that making them orgasm beyond what they can handle is a level of torture that satisfies my craving to be rough. I've never been 100% on the slamming girls around, even though it does trigger something for me so this is a much better side of BDSM that I enjoy."
