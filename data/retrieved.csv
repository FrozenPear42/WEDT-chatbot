I’m fairly open to most genres.,The Leftovers is gonna be tricky to describe exactly because it is so much more than it's synopsis. Basically 2% of the population disappear and we the audience follow a small group of characters in a town. Not a lot of people actually watched the show when it was on air but HBO kept it going because of how well it was rated by critics and fans.

Someone stayed at job, someone went to the different party, and most of the people just didn't show up without any notice.","I didn't plan to go anywhere. It seems like the 'fun' is too forced these days, along with people getting black out, vomiting drunk. The roads aren't safe either. I did my yearly 'letting go' ritual. I write everything I want to let go of from the prior year on a piece of paper. Then I burn it. Actually, I make a little raft of twigs, put it in a yellow envelope (I make it) and go across the street to the river. I sit in nature, a moment of meditation, then I set it on the little raft, set it afire, and let go of the bad things from the prior year, pusing it into the river with a stick. I have a bunch of little fireworks (sparklers, firecrackers) from the 4th of July, and I sat on my veranda with a cocktail and played with those until midnight. Then I stood, toasted the cold moon, and came inside. Probably one of the nicest, most relaxing NYE I've had in a while. It would have been nice to have one other person over, but I just couldn't figure out who in my friend group would be up for a quiet interactive with nature night. So, I planned my own. Christmas was really hectic with social obligations (I don't celebrate Christmas, but I do celebrate friends/family!) so it has been nice to have time alone."

Then my brother approached me to ask me how I was, and between sobs I told him that he is the only person I really love (true btw) and then he told my stepfather (because he was worried) and I ruined the whole mood"

Someone stayed at job, someone went to the different party, and most of the people just didn't show up without any notice.",Sorry about your party. I hope you enjoyed some lovely snacks at least. I was alone and was wishing there was just one other person around at midnight. Other than that I just realized I would rather be home alone than in a fake situation pretending I was having fun. I do wish I had planned for better snacks though. I microwaved a frozen chocolate lava cake just after midnight to have a bit of a treat. I hope the rest of the week goes better for you.

I stopped bathing at our lake a few years ago because I always felt a bit anxious about swimming in it (Probably doesn't help that we have pikes and ~25+ year-old carps in there which are probably around 60-70cm long haha), and the sea in particular creeps me out aswell. You can't see shit what's underwater depending on it's depth and/or quality! Also saw a Tuna hunt a swarm of fish once while on a boat, jumping out of the water and stuff, which made me think about what is down there even more :D"

But with family members, it’s the complete opposite. Anyone like that?","Wow, same. I have wondered constantly if anyone was like this with their family besides me. I just have a world view and beliefs that conflict so much with my family that I rarely have a conversation with them about anything at all, as it usually does not go over very well. It's sad and disheartening most often for me to go visit home, it feels like I'm surrounded by strangers most of the time. When I finally depart after visiting, I usually leave with this eerie feeling in my gut, recognizing a certain lonely piece of my soul where family felt like it was once, before I set off into the real world. It's like they're in a time capsule. Each time I visit it seems nothing has changed, no one has grown, just a cycle of the same old, same old. But I still see the people I love, just trapped behind some invisible barrier I can't reach through."

That would probably be the first step before this can be answered in a meaningful way. For me, genuinely happy probably means being at peace and not experiencing anxiety, worry, and stress. Unfortunately, I don't remember the last time I was that way. I always seem to experience these emotions to varying degrees and the intensity fluctuates over time. The last time when the levels were really low was probably when I was hiking. That was a few months ago. I guess this is an important reminder for what kind of activity I should be doing way more often..."
abr8wz,Whenwasthelasttimeyoufeltgenuinelyhappy? And why?,me and my bf couldn't spent new years together. but he called me ten minutes before midnight and we didn't talk much but him being there made me really happy •-•

You seem to be sacrificing a lot already (your car, your comfort, your ability to relax without being criticized) for her. The baby is not yours, you aren’t obligated to stick around and support her through the pregnancy. Not sure what area you’re from, but there are definitely other options for apartments in MN. Once you’re able to use your car, the options widen even more. I hope that everything works out! Moving in a MN winter sucks, but it’s doable. I’ll be doing it this month too haha so don’t let the winter stop you."

The boyfriend hasnt even talked to me about it and she claims it's because he is worried that I'm gonna judge him and make him feel ridiculous. And that's what shes done since we started living together. This guy was my best friend and now she is always telling me how much I get in his way. An example, he is trying to learn guitar and I've played for a number of years now. He was practicing in the garage and she came up to me and said that he was only practicing down there because he thought that I would go take the guitar away from him and show off and make him feel stupid. I'm not an idiot okay, the dude just wanted to practice where he could be alone and I totally respect that. He isnt gonna learn guitar from watching me."

I see from other comments that your lease is, sadly, not up for 10 months. You *could* see if you can find an escape clause (I mean, you're living with a couple who are about to have a baby, that's not really something most leases would address), or you *could* try to drag them both into Adult-World and have an Adult Conversation about rules and boundaries. It'd be good to get that out of the way, because if you think she's bad now imagine her on hormones... Either way, it's not too early for you to plan ahead. I'm sure you're looking for permanent work, so keep doing that (and do *not* compromise that with having to drive her around or anything). Explore other places you can move to in 10 months, and *have an emergency place to crash* in case you need it. Basically, even if they don't want to have that adult conversation... have it with yourself."

Your likes aren't saved, there is no collection, or favorites tab you can look back on them with, it's completely useless. And yet, having lots of them makes you feel validated in some way, and having none makes you feel like you're scum and trash...my instagram falls in the latter category (and boy do I ever feel terrible about myself for no explained reason). Its weird though, I do feel like its useless, but if it were removed, as others have said, it would be the end of the platform. Comments on the other hand, counting on the comment, I do feel are useful in the real world, human interaction kind of way."

That exists anyway, it's just made far more obvious with social media, it's likes, comments, selfies with filters, etc. The problem is it's all fake. People post ""good"" pictures which basically look nothing like them, or of the one clean corner of their house, or they drive to the top of a mountain and get out and take a picture in their Lu-Lu Lemon with their Nalgene bottle with a hikingislife hashtag. So that ton of likes they get mean shit because it's not real. They only feel partially validated, so they just do it again because their ego has built a dependency."

Instagram on the face of it is a social media app. But it really is just an advertising platform. People advertise themselves, they advertise products, they advertise each other. Liking things helps people prove their popularity and how many people they have contacted, and comments allows interactions about products and services.

The people who won't become your friends for this reason are those who are friends for others on sunny days only as well, the kind of people who run away at the first problem - so nothing you really want to be friends with at first place. And paying money doesn't buy you friends neither. It just pays people being around you, that's not exactly what's meant with the term ""friend""."

What are some things that you do to help inspire/motivate/empower yourself?","Look people in the eye. Practice speaking in a clear, confident voice (record yourself because you sound louder in your head than you really are). Dress well so you feel confident. Give firm handshakes. Repeat mantras to yourself in the mirror every morning (corny but it works)."

Be proud of who you are. Make eye contact with people. Smile. Say please and thank you. Appreciate when people do nice things for you. Do nice things for people with no expectation of anything in return. Think good thoughts about those in your life. If you are healthy, remember to stop and appreciate it. If you are not, do whatever you can to make small improvements in your health, and then be proud of these improvements, no matter how small. Try your best in whatever you do. Be proud of your achievements. Learn from your mistakes. Basically, pay attention to the small details and the things you can control. These are what define who you are."

What's the best way to learn if I don't have anyone who drives stick? Any help is appreciated :)","Ok, so this is how I was taught when I was an absolute beginner. It's a two step process, if you figure these two out you've won most of the battle. 1. Throttle control. Put the car in neutral and learn to hold the engine at a certain RPM. Pick a number, say 2000 rpm. Give just enough gas that the rpm needles hovers at 2000. Pick an other number, raise or lower the rpm to that number. Keep practicing this and soon you'll master throttle control. Driving a manual is just playing around with the RPMs 2. Figuring out the clutch engagement point. If you figure out how much of the clutch pedal you need to release you'll never stall, you'll never pop the clutch and crash into something. It's just muscle memory trust me."

Heck, maybe you can find a part time internship in your field and work both jobs until you get your foot in the door. Seasonal/temp work like festivals can earn you a few hundred bucks from a weekend's work. Also look into Americorps, they have year long positions in most American cities with little experience needed, they pay you a stipend, and at the end they give you about $4k of scholarship money for student debt, plus it looks good on a resume to have some government/nonprofit work under your belt. There's nowhere to go but up. I like your attitude and I wish you the best of luck."

I would probably become better liked by my family and by more people. But that really wouldn’t let me be at peace for real, would it?

acq9nh,BanjoPickin’ In August I got a banjo for my birthday. I have never played any string instrument. Ever. Does anyone have any tips or suggestions on how to learn to play a banjo?,"That’s great! That also happens to be the type I play. The style that is commonly played on the bluegrass banjo is called thee finger style. You play it with three finger picks, a plastic one on your thumb, and two light metal ones on your index and middle finger. I would recommend you buy a book to learn if no lessons are available in your area. The best book for beginners I would say is called “Ear Scruggs and the Five String Banjo.” Earl Scruggs is one of the pioneers of bluegrass banjo and the Scruggs style is very fundamentally sound and fun to learn. The book will wall you through everything from how to tune your banjo, how to put on the picks, to how to do rolls, slides, etc, and how to play some of the traditional tunes everyone should know. I would also recommend watching some beginners videos on YouTube or something."

acq9nh,BanjoPickin’ In August I got a banjo for my birthday. I have never played any string instrument. Ever. Does anyone have any tips or suggestions on how to learn to play a banjo?,"Hahaha you’re all good. Maybe you could describe it to me. The key difference between the types of banjo is whether or not they have a resonator. Old time banjos will look very vanilla, they have five strings and an open back, while bluegrass banjos have a resonator, they too are five strings but there is a resonator at the bottom of their round base and the back is not open, it is covered with the wood from the resonator."

Do a really good cleaning and then make sure you take up your cat food too.

It is basically salted, smoked and dried mutton meat. It's really tasty, beautifully textured, and exiting to eat, I love it. You basically buy these dried, smoked bones with meat on them from the store, or local farm. These need to lay in water for at least 24 hours. Then, you stack them up in a large boiler with oak sticks in the bottom, and water up to the sticks, and steam them for a few hours. Serve with a root mash and salty sausage."

Does anybody know the origin of this song and why the lyrics are the way they are?","John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt was born in Buffalo, New York in 1879. His mother, Katherine Irene Schmidt, (nee O'Cleary) was an immigrant from Ireland, who had left the ""Auld Sod"" back in 1849 as a young girl escaping the Potato Famine. She worked at the Broadhurst Manor Hotel as a maid, dishwasher, and cook's helper, saving every penny possible. Katie as she was called had a lovely singing voice. She claimed that her singing the songs of her childhood, and the church hymns made her feel less lonely for her family she had lost to the famine. (The local diocese had sent her and a brother to America to save them, but her brother died from fever on the way) One morning Katie was making the bed in one of the guest rooms, the occupant came back from breakfast early. He stood in the doorway, listening to her sing *Molly Malone* and his heart melted. He let out a sigh, and she turned to him, her green eyes wide with surprise, and, well...love at first sight. For both of them. The man was John Jacob Schmidt, born Johannes Yakub Schmidt in Lithuania. He was a baker recently moved to Buffalo to open his own bakery. After a whirlwind courtship they were married by a judge. John was Jewish, and Katherine a Roman Catholic. Due to this they were denied marriage sacraments from both faiths and so had a civil wedding. It took and they lived happily for many decades together. They had one child, a son with green eyes and curly red hair whom they named John Jacob. They doted on their only child and he was a cheery young lad and the apple of his mother's eye. His father taught him to be a baker and from his mother he learned to sing. When still a boy they would send him out in the early mornings, pushing a small cart of baked goods fresh from the oven, bread, hot cross buns, muffins, and kolacky. His singing notified neighbors to come buy his wares. One day, in a merry mood, he made up the words to *John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt*. It made people laugh and more people came to buy his baked goods. Soon his parents had to hire a helper to keep up with the increased sales. Well, the rest is history. John Jacob the Younger married a neighborhood beauty named Jania Louise, the daughter of the green grocers. Their family get-togethers were filled with love, laughter and music. And, that's the way it all happened."

How do I get my first follower?,"Karma doesn't do anything. Most subs limit your ability to post until you have some nominal amount of karma (like 20-50), to weed out low-effort spambot accounts. Mostly it's a manifestation of how much the community likes/agrees with your posts. I'd recommend googling ""reddit &lt;topic you're interested in&gt;"" to find specific communities. Otherwise, you'll just encounter them surfing around reddit. A lot of the default pages are ass, don't feel bad about unsubscribing from them if you don't like them. Followers don't really matter here, it's not like Instagram or anything. Just a different culture."

This is ridiculous to me: it's just more trash. Man, one person was just blown away by this idea, like I was drawing pictures of Mohammed or something, and eventually wound up calling me a troll and blocking me.

Interesting stories?","Scrabble for us. Also card games. No more monopoly, it’s long and someone always ends up mad. Played tons of board games while kids were little too. We all loved The game of Life."

It’s not fair, but then neither is life nor Monopoly played by the real rules!"
ad1hwh,"PlayedMonopolywiththefamtonight Never felt that much residual loathing before. In honor of this, what're y'all's experience with board games? Any favorites? Interesting stories?","There are two games I refuse to ever play with family. Monopoly and Yahtzee. You don't think someone would be hyper-competitive during these games. Oh but believe me, my mother is as cutthroat as I've seen with the game. She would take any opportunity to play and she yells at any positive, and jeers at any downturn. Passes go? Exaggeratedly claims that cash money. Buys a property set? Celebration. To prove my point on how bad it is, She played a 13 year old recently. She destroyed that kid's like for the game and never played again with that poor, poor child. She almost sounded proud. Thinking about it, I just straight refuse to play Monopoly because of her. And that was years ago since we last played."
ad1hwh,"PlayedMonopolywiththefamtonight Never felt that much residual loathing before. In honor of this, what're y'all's experience with board games? Any favorites? Interesting stories?","Monopoly is easily my favorite game. My family won't play it with me anymore but my best friend and I grew up playing it. I have over 200 different official versions of the game and a lot of other Monopoly collectibles as well. &amp;#x200B; I have two favorite stories from playing it: 1. My family (parents/sister/myself) wanted to play a game and my best friend was staying the night so we suggested Monopoly. We basically ganged up on the res of the family and knocked them out quickly and finished up playing just the two of us. 2. I was staying at my best friend's over the summer when we were younger and his dad had to be up at like 5am for work and asked if we wanted to play until he went to bed. We said sure and with all of their house rules, the games wouldn't end. His dad lost track of time during the multiple games and by the time the last game finished it was 4:30 and he had to get ready for work. We started the first game at 8pm. Best friend's mom was not happy with any of us. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;"

adcujp,IguesstodayIsmycakeday! I was getting prepared to go to a family party when I comment on a overwatch post and I saw a cake beside my name. Woo I guess ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ So how's your day going?!,"You have to put three in a row in order to display the \\ there! It's because \\ is the ""escape character"". Reddit interprets text input into comment boxes via a markup language called Markdown. Markdown has some special functions, like how you can italicize text by putting it in between a pair of asterisks: *Hello* But what if you want to literally display: \*Hello* Well, you have to tell Markdown ""Hey, I know this pair of asterisks normally makes words italic, but don't do that this time. Just show the actual character I've typed."" \\ is the character that does that. Markdown doesn't display the \\ directly; it just invalidates the normal special behavior of various types of annotation, like the asterisk pair. On this comment, click ""Source"" and see the \\'s I've got to make \*Hello* and other things display correctly. Okay, so now consider that we want to literally display a \\. To do that, you have to tell Markdown ""Hey, so \\ normally acts as an invisible escape character but I want you to actually show it this time."" This means you have to escape-character the \\ itself. So in this comment's source you'll see a lot of \\\ everywhere. Finally, there's one more thing going on in the shrug guy emoticon. In Markdown, the underscore pair also normally _\_italicizes_\_ text. There's an underscore pair in the emoticon, so you also have to tell Markdown that you don't want it to italicize the face. So you need \\\ to make \\ appear, and then \\ to make _ look normal."

adf9a8,WhatchauptoCasCon? I'm currently cozied up watching Infinity War for the zillionth time and eating a big ole piece of Chocolate Creme pie. What are you fellow night owls and the like up to at the moment?,Never read the GoT books even though I absolutely love the show lol but I would definitely recommend reading the Hobbit first to just kinda dip your toes in the water then knock out the rest in order. Definitely great reads but not short ones so I'd just prefer yourself for that beforehand

I might just be cynical because I've had people conveniently show up in my life around birthdays/holidays and then vamoose after receiving something. That's dope. I've never really dabbled in fiction like that but I've been meaning to. Would you recommend the LotR series? I think the last fantasy book I purchased was the first title of GoT but couldn't get past the first chapter."

Sucks it didn't go anywhere but if you expect something back for every gift you'll just be disappointed.

The thing is, is that it is illegal to block cell phones unless there is a legitimate threat in the vicinity, think remotely detonated weapons. The other question at hand is cellular internet being blocked versus cellular phone function being unblocked. If that is the case, cell phone companies are doing something weird in that area, because you cannot physically separate cellular internet and cellular calling since they are on the same frequency."

The worst part of it for me was not being able to eat normal foods. You get quite sick of eating the same few foods over again. Other than that it wasn’t an unpleasant experience. The sleep was amazing

admx2f,JanuarysucksforValets Well it isn’t due to the cold weather or anything it just comes down to it being slow in hospitality. 2 check in’s left and 7 hours of my shift left.,I use to valet at this very high end luxury hotel. Hourly didn’t get paid much and tips were decent to great but only on Sundays. Great meaning $150 sometimes rarely upwards of $200 but normally between $40-$70 a day. Then I also would valet for some luxury apartments. There hourly pay was decent and during the week between 7-9am and 4-6pm it was steady but after that it was mostly dead during the day. Didn’t get tipped there except during Christmas. Now I work downtown at a 4 star hotel and get paid decent hourly and tips can vary between $5-$150 a night. I’ve driven lots of nice cars but then it gets kind of old and if someone else wants to park it then I just let them. Less work for me.

admx2f,JanuarysucksforValets Well it isn’t due to the cold weather or anything it just comes down to it being slow in hospitality. 2 check in’s left and 7 hours of my shift left.,Valet is a great job but slow season doesn’t give you a real idea of what busy nights can look like. During slow season you just stand there on your phone and no one really gets mad if you walk to pick up a car. We teach through example and when it’s slow there just isn’t anything going on. It’s also misleading because during the spring/summer it gets real busy and when people get used to just standing around it builds bad habits and the last thing they will want to do is actually work. “Working” consists of a lot of running.

Of course, there were days when it was in the high 30Cs even up to 40s, but mostly it’s been 60sF-70Fs. And much to my surprise, I’ve yet to see any deadly creatures that Australia is known for lol.

Being open about things (not necessarily with me, but with each other) is another main thing. Not expecting the other person to change *for them*, but also not expecting the other person to remain the same and let them grow into who they are - basically they both have to be independent and have their own identity (no manipulation or forcing the partner to not do/do certain things) Tbf, i think everyone deserves this kind of relationship. The difference for my child (which will never happen, but its an hypothetical) would be that i could teach them about healthy relationships and stop a toxic relationship if i see that they are living in one (unfortunately cannot do this with friends)"

ae1c2c,MyeatinghabitisgettingbadIthink It's like slicing the 1/5 of a hotdog then getting 3 tbspn of rice everytime. The portion is too much like I just want to be full and not to enjoy the food. I don't know if it's fine or what,Everyday I take fried rice/normal rice with eggs + chicken hotdog then lunch usually meat + rice also. At night I just take a glass of hot milk.

I don't know if it's fine or what,"Ah yep makes more sense that way. Though I'd still say that ratios of food groups/types isn't anything to obsess over unless you're a major fitness buff worried about exact amounts of protein and carbs and whatnot. Just eat reasonably healthy food and you'll already be ahead of most people in the world. If you're finding you're not enjoying food, maybe look at adding more seasoning and working with more exotic flavours? There's a world world of cooking out there to make dishes that should absolutely be savoured."

Can anyone share the pain?","I'm 20 and I rent a room in the basement of a family home. Let me also say that I am a major introvert, been known to not be seen for a week or so if I go on a bender. (Two parents and their son upstairs; their daughter (friend of mine), another friend, and me downstairs.) It has it's ups and downs. I like that even though I don't want/have to talk to people that the house isn't empty. Soon enough you will learn to deal with everyone's habits, sharing the kitchen, etc. It is fair to say that a lot of time might be in your own room though. That's ok. Get a desk and/or a comfy arm chair. It's not so great to be in bed all the time for everything. My sister has shared rooms with 2 sets of randos off Craigslist, both of which have worked out well. The first was an older woman who rented a room in a house she owned and the situation was fine although the power dynamic was evident. What ended up working out better was to find a group of people (3) who are also renting and they went in on a lease together. One of their names is actually on the lease with the landlord so she has a bit more stake in the game I guess but they all moved in at the same time and no one feels as if it's ""their"" house and the others are guests. They are all also +/- 3 years from each other though and that helps."

And people are more likely to review if they have particularly good or bad (especially bad) experiences.

It's been a couple of years, but some really big sites once didn't really checked their advertisers and some people ended up catching themselves some ransomware. Can't find the article right now, but it's called [malvertising](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malvertising) and the Wiki article does give some prominent examples. A site being very big, doesn't mean that their ads will be quality. You have to be careful no matter where you are. If you thought people who use adblockers are just being assholes, then that's somewhat wrong. Well, someone once said something along the line of ""if you don't pay for food and don't pay for rent, then you are the product"". Holds true every time in this heavily commercialized iteration of the internet. I remember times when it was somewhat different."

Mini Komodo dragon is up to interpretation BUT they are extremely motivated due to a rough childhood past.","Tiger. 100% The bigger tiger increases the amount of fur which is a pretty effective defense on it's own. Add the reduced size of the Komodos and they're going to have to work pretty hard to injure the tiger. So here is how I see it going down. Tiger drinking from a lovely pool of crystal clear water. Defences down and relaxing in the warm sun. The smaller Komodo somehow manage to sneak up on the tiger and set about taking the tiger down. They latch on to the legs as best they can, causing the tiger to leap away in fright. It's huge, muscular body powers it 25ft away with ease. The Komodo cannot hang on and are scattered around. The tiger turning in the air spots it's assailants. Now facing them it can easily track them. The Komodo, startled, regroup, with two moving around in the hopes of sneaking up behind the Tiger. The tiger leaps again, closing the distance between it and the Komodo almost instantly, knocking one komodo back, instantly killing the other with a bite to the head, a swift swipe to another causing terrible injury and essentially taking it out of the fight. With that it continues pretty much in the same ilk. Tiger closing the distance quickly, simple accurate strikes. Komodo are formidable creatures. But in a straight up battle even normal sized the Tigers agility is going to give it a considerable edge. Given it's increased size, and their reduced size it's quite an easy win for the cat"

I don’t want to minimize your experience by claiming to relate to them. People are capable of being horrible. Every human interaction is situational and definitions of bullying can vary. Bantering is ok if you have a deeply personal relationship with a person that is like minded. If you do this, you owe it to your friend to make sure you do not cross the line."
ae9xt6,"whenthereismajorbullyinginschool,whydootherstudentsoftenignoreit? when there is major bullying in school, why do other students often ignore it? is it because the person getting bullied is unpopular or is it because nobody wants to stand up to the bully?","&gt;While adult bullying does exist, many times it is banter. I have seen full on adult bullying in the work place, and it was not banter. Sometimes negative joking causes the most harm, especially if you don't know the person. &amp;#x200B; ""Kids rarely have the finesse necessary to execute a proper jab..."" There were things said to me in the 7th grade that were so mean I remember them now. I'm 30."
ae9xt6,"whenthereismajorbullyinginschool,whydootherstudentsoftenignoreit? when there is major bullying in school, why do other students often ignore it? is it because the person getting bullied is unpopular or is it because nobody wants to stand up to the bully?","I think adults generally have a better understanding of context. While adult bullying does exist, many times it is banter. Kids rarely have the finesse necessary to execute a proper jab because they don’t understand the emotions that adults have learned to harness. As such, they also fail to understand and react to those moments in a socially acceptable way. When my buddies and I go golfing, we regularly berate and abuse one another. While onlookers may accuse us of bullying, we know we systematically lift each other’s pride while also keeping everyone’s ego in check. It is a delicate balance of knowing what buttons to press (or not press) and when. Knowing your audience is crucial. Do I support bullying at any level? Absolutely not. Do I coddle my children when they are bullied? A little. I also use opportunities like this to teach them right from wrong and proper coping skills to life’s challenges. While some adults chose to not get involved out of fear or ambivalence, some might look at it as a growing opportunity. All of this is operating under the assumption that health and safety are not in jeopardy. If someone is going to get hurt, everyone should chose the high road and intervene."

Which was both saddening and inspiring to me. Letting go of loved ones is extremely difficult, but also extremely important and I'd even say respectful. If you believe you can replace a person with a copy, what does it say about you? Nothing good. Even if he obviously does it out of desperation. The other message that this video clearly shows me is that life is a petite flower, and you should always treat it as such. This boy lived as if you always get a second chance for everything.

Guess it’s good luck that I posted here! I’ll check up on you tomorrow if you’d like, since my eyes are getting heavy. Thank you so much for venting with me, I feel like a weight has been lifted. I didn’t think anyone would understand and at worst, I thought they would judge me harshly.

Drop on by!","Yeah, there’s just no easy way around any of this. And I actually think what makes it so uncomfortable is they know the fact that they are wrong. How can they not? Much like you’re friend caught and corrected herself with the sisters-in-law thing. Similar example to this is about 3 months ago when I asked my friend if we could use her car this time around. I’m the one who always drives and I always use my car. (She’s made me drive her car before because of her anxiety.) She doesn’t pay for gas and leave garbage in it when I drop her off. And she point blank says to me “No, I don’t trust other people using my car after my brother trashed and ripped the door off.” Yes, she let her junkie brother use the car but not me, her best friend of 17 years, who’s never been in an accident. (I’m 23, so I’ve been driving for hot minute and I feel like I’m doing pretty damn good.) That was one of the last nails in the coffin because that ultimately proved she didn’t trust me. At all. And with everything else, she seems to not even like me."

So we're all super close and we're basically married at this point except we don't have that pretty little piece of paper. So I call his sister my sister-in-law. I have never ever heard my friend call her boyfriend's sister her sister-in-law. She'll say ""my coworker"", ""my friend"", or ""my boyfriend's sister"". Well we were hanging out the other night and she was telling a story and was like ""....my coworker..."" then she looked at my and my SIL and was like ""...I mean my sister-in-law..."" So I can't call her out on that. We all know why she said it. It was the first thing my SIL mentioned when my friend left. But how stupid would I look if I was like ""You never call her your SIL. Why that night? Hmmm???"" She's never going to say ""Because I'm jealous of yours and your sister-in-law's relationship."" So in the end I just end up looking like an asshole."

It’s actually disgraceful how incompetent many of the employees are, including the management. There are things I like about my job, but I find it very stressful. I’m on a project that is supposed to last until summer 2020, and I am considering bailing once the project is done. It’s hard to make friends because I have to travel a bit for my position and because the work means long hours and a lot of exhaustion. I just tell myself that I need to make it for 18 more months. I can see this project through - and then I’ll happily trade down for a lower-stress job at a company or organization that actually makes a difference in the world."

Has anyone tried comparing search engine results for popular keywords?,"It’s not about illegal, it’s about collecting data about you, your interests, whatever you searched. Lets make an example. Once you searched “asian porn”. Google will remember it, and all the google banners will show you asian porn. Next time you’ll search “asia”, google will show you asian porn first, and then something about history and culture. Or, if you search “porn”, google will show you asian one first, and most popular porn will be shown after that. Instead, DDG doesn’t remember your history and every search result is shown like you’ve searched it for the first time."

Any color within the eyes aside from that is the result of the Tyndell effect (i.e. a scattering of light in the stroma of the eye). Why is that important? Because brown eyes will typically look the same regardless of the fluctuation of light or light source, so long as it's a spectrum of white light. However light colored eyes will reflect different wavelengths of light depending upon the source and other external factors. So the reason why there's no consensus on your eye color is that in different situations, there may be slight enough variations in the reflection of light to make your eyes look like a different color. Also, regarding the internet, people's monitors are calibrated differently with regard to color, so you're going to have wide variations on that front as well. &amp;#x200B;"

aeg07t,"Haveyouguyseverheardofthesleepsort? It's a sorting algorithm that entails cordoning each element of an int array to a sleep timer in a separate thread. When the timer elapsed, put it back into your array. Super",Say you have the numbers 1 1 1 1 2 and 3. If it takes longer than 3 time units to sort the 1s then the order of 2 and 3 is indeterministic (i.e. depends on the thread scheduling of your OS)!

aeg07t,"Haveyouguyseverheardofthesleepsort? It's a sorting algorithm that entails cordoning each element of an int array to a sleep timer in a separate thread. When the timer elapsed, put it back into your array. Super","&gt;It's a sorting algorithm that entails cordoning each element of an int array to a sleep timer in a separate thread. When the timer elapses, put it back into your array. Super &gt;It's a sorting algorithm It's a method for arranging the elements in a collection based on magnitude &gt;that entails cordoning each element of an int array to a sleep timer in a separate thread. So a thread is like a segment of processor resources that your computer uses to complete a task. Your brain has a bunch of threads, some of them are being used to do things like keep your heart pumping and your nervous system working. You can think about how to spell the word ""Acetone"" while juggling without your heart stopping because your brain can run all of these processes simultaneously on multiple processor threads. That's called multithreading. &gt;sleep timer One thing you can do with thread is make it do nothing at all (sleep) for some length of time, measured in milliseconds. &gt;When the timer elapses, put it back into your array. So as an example, let's say we have a collection of numbers. {7, 15000, 5} If we assign a sleep timer (measured in milliseconds) with a wait time of each element in this collection, we'll have waited a total 7+15000+5=15012 ms. However, since we can use multithreading to set a sleep timer for all of them simultaneously, we only have to wait as long as the largest number (15000). So the rule is that after a sleep timer elapses, we take the time we waited in ms for that timer and put it into a collection. Think of it like a race, where whichever number finishes first gets to go into the new collection first. Sleep(7); Sleep(15000); Sleep(5); 5 obviously wins first place, and it gets added to a collection after 5 ms. {5} Next would be 7, in second place. {5, 7} Then obviously, the largest guy, 15000. {5, 7, 15000} So the list is sorted now, smallest to biggest. This is kind of a joke sort, though. What happens when you have a list of elements that has two elements in it, and the elements are (for instance) {5 000 000 000 000, 1} The sort would take 5 trillion ms to complete (a little over 158 years) when it would be a simple matter to compare the two numbers, see which ones is smaller, and stick that one in front. We could solve it by hand way faster than we could solve it with a computer, which is silly. So that's ~~Wonderwall~~ sleep sort in a nutshell."

Perhaps twice a year for short you could meet with random people through sites like meetup dot com. Chances are people from most cultural backgrounds want to experience minimal living. I hope that you are happy with it so far. I am not capable of this as of now.

Without a family it would not have been possible for me from an emotional/social standpoint."

At first I was permitted to work from home for the same company I was employed by downstate but after a layoff I changed careers. Less money, but the cost of living is lower here. Here, living a quiet life is mostly about not needing much. We traded convenience and cultural opportunities for nature and less people. I miss cultural diversity most."

aemon5,"[justcutofftieswithabestfriendof3years] I thanked him for everything he has done for me ,he knows me better than anyone else At this time writing this I'm kinda feeling weird How did u cope with the first days?",I disagree I’ve made some brilliant friends at work and kept in touch with them after I left. OP don’t take this comment seriously just because it happened to the commentator doesn’t mean it’s going to happen to you.
aemon5,"[justcutofftieswithabestfriendof3years] I thanked him for everything he has done for me ,he knows me better than anyone else At this time writing this I'm kinda feeling weird How did u cope with the first days?",Hope you are doing well and take care of yourself!! I had a best friend in middle school for 3-4 years. We drifted apart because of my family moving around and didn’t want to worry him about personal problems. It sucked but I figured as we grew up... our interests changed. We used to update on life but that is pretty much it.

aep29j,"ihaveextremeanxietybutwhenimdrunkI'mtotallyfine. is crazy, i can't talk to girls or even be comfortable out in a crowd of people unless I'm drunk. worst part is, i hate drinking. why is that?","I was like this too. In my late teens early 20s is when I started it. I was tired of being quiet and shy and if I got some liquor in me I would quit caring what people thought of me. I could hold conversations easier and do things I normally wouldn’t do sober. Eventually it took a turn for the worse because it got to a point where I couldn’t go anywhere unless drinking was involved, I also started drinking heavily, it went from a couple shots to a fifth of whiskey and a case of beer in one night. It put me in a lot of really bad and dangerous situations and I almost lost my job and a couple friendships because of it. I would advise you to not let it become a crutch, there is absolutely nothing wrong with having a good time, but you have to know when it goes from being fun to an actual problem."
aep29j,"ihaveextremeanxietybutwhenimdrunkI'mtotallyfine. is crazy, i can't talk to girls or even be comfortable out in a crowd of people unless I'm drunk. worst part is, i hate drinking. why is that?","How do you feel about yourself when sober? Maybe drunk you isn’t so self conscious so your personality can shine more, maybe drunk you knows that no matter how bad a conversation with a stranger goes the worst thing that happens is you get laughed at for a minute then move on so you sit over think things. Do you feel anxious sober talking to everyone or just girls? As a super shy person as a kid my one piece of advice to get over it is talk to EVERYONE. About anything. Have a convo with a girl that you have zero interest in. I got a job in customer service and had to talk to people and i let that spill over into my personal life."
aep29j,"ihaveextremeanxietybutwhenimdrunkI'mtotallyfine. is crazy, i can't talk to girls or even be comfortable out in a crowd of people unless I'm drunk. worst part is, i hate drinking. why is that?",This is me. But I don't mind drinking if I'm with a big group of friends as I can stick by them until I get drunk enough to go meet people.
aep29j,"ihaveextremeanxietybutwhenimdrunkI'mtotallyfine. is crazy, i can't talk to girls or even be comfortable out in a crowd of people unless I'm drunk. worst part is, i hate drinking. why is that?",Funny I'm the opposite. Confidence out the roof when sober. As soon as I start drinking I suffer from really bad anxiety!

It's a plant and will probably be on par with alcohol in terms of big developers vs. the microbrew variety.

Before him, only expletives-laden songs were considered rap. Kanye West brought beats, rhythm and melody into songs. And how (listen to 'Touch the Sky')!"
aevi73,KanyeWestmightbeapieceofwork... But his songs are great! I like Touch the Sky more than Move on Up? Anyone else think critical brain damage from his accidents hasn't affected his musical prowess?,"Ngl I feel like people claim those people^ are goats just because they were big when the genre first blew up. It's like saying buddy Holly was the greatest rockstar. The genre evolved into what it is today and there's many people who are responsible for it like Lil b and chief keef, but Kanye put rap into a new perspective IMO and that's why I consider him the goat. He killed gangster rap and made rap more of an artistic genre."
aevi73,KanyeWestmightbeapieceofwork... But his songs are great! I like Touch the Sky more than Move on Up? Anyone else think critical brain damage from his accidents hasn't affected his musical prowess?,I don't really know. I don't think Dr. Dre has a claim to it. Tupac Shakur has made some good songs. Jay Z made has made some good songs. Ice Cube has made some good songs. I don't think Snoop Dogg can claim that title either.

I overthink things i've said again and again and wonder if it was stupid, and some days I don't like myself too! What works for me is to take deep breaths and tell myself, it's in the past and I can't change it,that's okay. I am who I am and if someone can't accept that,it's their problem. Just do your best each day and take it a day at a time. Find someone close to you and maybe try and tell them about how you feel? Or perhaps see a therapist?

I then tried your typical North American light/blonde beers - corona, Keith’s, blue moon - and liked some but not others. Best advice I would recommend is going to a local brewery if available and try a flight of a few different beers with different flavours to see what you like: you may like brown or red ales or sour ales but you’ll only know by experience. I drink almost any beer now but it took me awhile to develop the taste buds from it by experience."

The problem being the way the eyes are placed on whales would restrict field of view. The solution being echolocation, using screeches to find its way around."

Don't go when they go out to party and hang out with them more during the day when they aren't (possibly) drinking that much. I was always the sober one, I was too poor to go drinking at the bars and honestly just didn't drink much. My friends embraced having a DD (designated driver) when they went into the city and always invited me. They always made sure I was having a good time and if I ever wasn't into where we were, they would pick a new place or hit up the liquor store and head to the house to party there. I guess I was always pretty lucky in that I always had a good time with them, even when they were all drunk and I wasn't. During house parties (which I think we all greatly preferred), it was also more likely that there would be other non drinkers or light drinkers hanging out, too. I met a lot of awesome people through my friends' parties, and have some awesome memories. All that to say, though, if you're not having fun woth that group, find another group to add to your tribe. You dont have to do all tthings together all the time just because you're friends. Mix it up and branch out. Eventually people get over the excessive drinking, but until then, just fill your social card with those more in line with what your interests are."

Doing tech is a good way to be involved if you’re not a performing type. Non-drinkers are always in the minority. I worked in bars on weekends too, after college, if you can believe it. I worked the door and was always the one sober guy in the room. But it was my choice, so I wasn’t upset about it. Until the idiots really started to come out of thr woodwork at about 1:45AM. I wasn’t always the most patient. I guess what I’m saying is, find a nondrinking activity, or at least an activity you can do while not drinking. Bowling leagues are fun, Or make friends who are non-drinkers and invite them over to your place to cook or watch movies."

For harder solos, I use Audacity and slow down the tempo without affecting the pitch. It's more convenient to use since you can isolate specifically a part in the song. With Youtube, you need to manually go back and press play everytime. With Audacity, you can loop the segment as long as you want it. And it's a free software, I've been using it for the last 10 years."

Blues chord progressions are pretty much the same so it's not too complicated to learn. &amp;#x200B; Play That Funky Music/Wild Cherry, Blackbird/The Beatles, Sunny/Bobby Hebb, any jazz standards(Autumn Leaves, Blue Bossa, Straight No Chaser). &amp;#x200B; It really depends of what you like.

So an Enigma equals the infinity + 1, infinity + 2, etc. Am I a visionary for creating a new number that no one has ever thought to call infinity + 1?","Mhmm, fascinating, though I fail to see how it helps anybody, particularly since there are other numbers larger than the classically imagined infinity that have proven to be useful in certain kinds of mathematics, whereas yours seems to lack such usefulness. How is it different to Omega numbers, Aleph numbers, or uncountable infinities, and what can be done with this axiom that isn't just describing itself?"

So an Enigma equals the infinity + 1, infinity + 2, etc. Am I a visionary for creating a new number that no one has ever thought to call infinity + 1?","But infinity isn't a number. There's no quantifiable value assigned to it. Infinity is the highest possible numerical value, so to add 1 would just make it infinity, and repeatedly adding 1 will continue the process... Wait for it Wait for it Wait for it Infinitely"

Any number/concept with another number added to is bigger by one. Therefore infinity + 1 is Enigma.

Should I feel mad, should I be happy for them?","100%. It's such a conflicting feeling. I've been in Australia 17 years of my life, as opposed to the 6 I had in Germany so my life is pretty much in Australia. I did all my schooling there, met my friends there and my partner. I was planning to move out this year anyway but it was all a big shock to me when I found out they wanted to go back after being in Australia for so long... It's just weird to think about. I'm in Germany on holiday with them at the moment and I leave for Aus next week so I think that's when it'll all sink in. I have a lot to focus on when I get back, like selling my parent's car and some of their furniture they left behind and looking for full-time work and a place to live. That'll be stressful and exciting at the same time. and will keep me occupied a little bit I guess."

afeqz1,"Doesanyoneelsehatewhenpeopleaskwhatdoyoudoinyourfreetime? Maybe it’s because I spend so much time on Reddit and YouTube, but I never really have a good response and cringe when it comes up in small talk.","I agree, a lot of people I know in real life would probably say the same, that their hobbies are watching TV or hanging out with friends. I wonder if it's because people are so drained during the day (school, work) that when they get home, they just resort to low commitment, chill, ""passive"" activities. Also, I feel like internet activities are still seen on a different level of IRL hobbies. Like, I can't tell my co-workers that I read 70k word fanfiction in my spare time, but I can tell them what published book I'm reading at the moment. Activities like making music, drawing, sports, etc. are probably what people are looking for when they ask what my hobbies are. What's prevented me from completely sinking myself into hobbies like those in the long term are probably the fact that they take up more time, money, and effort than doing anything on the internet. Those are probably the biggest deterrents. I make crafts casually, but I don't know that I'm qualified to call it my hobby because I do them on and off with big time gaps."

I like to show them multiple sides of things and allowing them to come up with their own conclusions. One of the most important aspects of my faith is that we can NEVER know everything, and that it’s okay to make our best guess. There are a few occasions where I’m not “allowed” to do this (for lack of a better word) because of my denomination’s beliefs. I’m a part of the United Methodist Church, and the issue of ordaining and marrying openly LGBTQ+ people is a big one. Currently, our doctrine states that although we should love everyone, God created marriage to be between a man and a woman. I totally disagree with this. When a student asks me about this issue, I simply state that at THIS church, this is what you will learn, but that plenty of people disagree, and If you’re one of them that’s okay. If you disagree so much that it makes you uncomfortable to be here, there are a lot of places and resources I can recommend for you."

The reason it doesn't change the songs is because it looks for music most closely related to what you like and have asked for, so if you don't change up what you want, it wont really add more music to your queue because the music playing is technically what you asked for. The algorithm could be changed a bit, like maybe slow down on playing the same song more than like 3x in a 24hr period and look for other things to maybe make it more interesting.

Thank you","I’m not an expert on grammar by any means, but it looks like it’s being used to insert an independent clause acting as a qualifier. If you removed the region within the hyphens, the sentence would still make perfect sense, so a comma isn’t applicable. A semicolon is usually used to link two independent clauses on the same topic. “I’m going to the store; Wednesday is my favorite day to go to the store.” I would imagine it’s used to clarify something like in the example sentence you used. Not sure though. Any English teachers care to weigh in?"

I live with my parents so I eat what is put on the table, but when I cook for myself I try not to buy too much meat since I don't feel comfortable buying it. However, vegemite (braned under a different name) is the fucking bomb. It tastes so fucking good and I'd prefer it over every deli meat for breakfast. Also almond milk tastes very good."

I'm learning Latin, which many people may not perceive as the most practical of languages, but should I be required to learn another romance language in my career I'll be very well prepared. As someone who's very into history and the history of science, I'm also feeling like I'm gaining a lot by learning Latin. Anyhow. Learning any language is something that's very dependent on small, repetitive efforts. It's something you don't have to do for long, but something you have to do every day. I think it's also a good exercise in the building of positive habits. If you can spare 30 to 60 minutes per day over a two year span you can learn a language. This kind of willingness to repeat comes in very handy when you have something that you need to repeat for hours and hours per day, but maybe only for a semester. Another great habit to pick up is going to the gym, but that's not for everyone."

Thank you for reading!,"Something that helped me was I sat down and I wrote a letter to him. I gave it a few days, because in the beginning I was so willing to say whatever to get him back, but as a few days went by i was able to pinpoint all of what made him and us wrong. Then I could write a letter, maybe its about how mad at him you are, maybe it's about things you feel need to be said. I never sent mine, but I almost contemplated on it. Either way it helped me get what I need said, even if he never heard it. It took me a long time to get used to him not in my life, because he had been the closest thing I had to a best friend, and talked all day every day but after we stopped I was able to see how toxic it really was. I was able to overcome it all, no regrets or wishes to talk to him again. I'm getting married this year to someone who treats me the way I deserve. All things end for a reason, you too will find your peace. Good luck!"

agbfxi,"What'sapositivechangethat'soccurredinyourliferecently? I've been going on more walks, re-connecting with friends, eating healthier, and so on. What have you been doing that's been a positive change in your life?","Fitness! Strength! Heroism! I've been successfully bulking for about 2 months now. I've gained 20 pounds, of which a little more than half should be muscle. I'm no stranger to fitness and the gym but my history with eating disorders and bad habits resulted me in seriously plateauing and spinning my wheels. Being somewhat fit, but not building strength or getting anywhere out of poor habits and fear of growing my waistline. What I needed was a goal. And I picked a ridiculous one. I've been going to anime conventions for a couple of years now but never really attempted to do cosplay due to my unusual proportions - being 6'8"", long limbed, and unusually broad shouldered. Until I discovered My Hero Academia - the story of a powerless young man who works his way up from nothing to become the world's top superhero. Its one of the most popular anime out right now but I've never seen a guy properly cosplay its most popular character: All Might. Because All Might is over 7 feet tall and fucking JACKED. At 6'8"", with a broad shouldered build I figured I'm in a better position than anyone to tackle this mighty cosplay. I always wanted to build muscle and properly bulk but my history of anorexia plagued me daily from eating enough to make gains. Even after recovering from the disorder and putting over 50 pounds on my formerly skeletal frame that primal fear of getting fat prevented me from really going for it. But now I am! My lifts are getting bigger! And heavier! And I'm gaining weight! And yeah my belly is getting a bit bigger but so are my shoulders, and I've even accidentally torn through the sleeves of my old shirts by flexing. It sounds dumb to get pumped from an anime but the aesop of My Hero Academia, the characters, and everything about it has inspired me. I have just shy of 1 year to pull it off. I started at 255. Now I'm at 275. My end goal after a bulk/cut cycle is to reach 300 by the end of this year without having put on too much fat in the end. Time to go plus ultra!"

We would fly to visit each other every other month or so. Flying through Spirit airline was fairly cheap too. Boston to Miami roundtrip was like $80 depending when you go. I suggest understanding that people have busy lives and preparing for some kind of distance if there ever will be. It doesn't always happen or it doesn't always happen at first. So don't get disheartened when no one responses asap. Just talk when you can and make sure to catch up when you can."
agfh3o,Keepinglongdistancefriends. Am trying to move away from gaming. But want to keep the people I've grown up with since i don't have others around me. Any good tips to maintaining it?,"I moved out to a different state for work last April. I moved away from family and my best friend. I'd have to say that calling and talking to them on the phone is pretty good. My best friend and I talk on the phone almost every day. I call and talk to my parents once a week. Sure, there's texting, there's emails, there's whatever else, but people can forget to respond to messages. And it doesn't feel as close. I used to not like talking on the phone, but now I'm on the phone at least once a day with either my friend or my family."

Especially if I should have known better.","Both? Like that's what it is being a human, things and feelings change ALL THE TIME. One part of me says that everything sucks anyways. A lowkey nihilistic manner. I really don't feel like a lot of the stuff, me, one little individual has the power to do, matters so much. But that's also just in a shallow way. Overall i'm pretty happy and quite positive about people and the world. It's just really important that you have someone to talk about your failure or other stuff in life. That's what makes me able to process, progress and become a better person. I think that, not caring is my recovery programme, from when things don't work out well and i get tired of being positive. It's just important that you get back on the horse, and remember or find something that gives you a reason to become positive again."

agfqxp,"Cananyonerelate? Whenever I make a mistake, I ‘beat’ myself up especially if the mistake has consequences. I just can’t believe what an idiot I was. Especially if I should have known better.","Without being an expert, but in psychology i remember learning about this being a very toxic way of treating yourself after failure. Physically aswell as mentally. My personal advice is that we're not damn robots and to be more relaxed with stuff. I'm super chill (maybe even too much) and that really helps me whenever i meet failure, also in a constructive way. You can read a little about how to react after failure here: https://lifehacker.com/how-to-move-past-failure-1597951611 There's tonnes of other articles and guides aswell. Another tip is, thank god we have google. It can really help us improve as characters."

There is a weird thing going on where everyone is getting overly sensitive about anything regarding social issues. People speak as of they are being attacked. I criticize that because there are worse problems in the world than dealing with someone's non binding rhetoric. I feel like people are losing a balanced perspective on reality. Other than that, I normally respond with personal experience, questions, or jokes. Ah. My post history has stuff about like how I have a foot fetish and, weird, calve muscle fetish. There have been a few times I've admitted to have an external hard drive with gigs of saved porn. Or how I don't even want to bang hot chicks, I'd rather watch normal looking couples have sex and jerk it in the corner. It's who I am. Embrace who you are. You are allowed to grow and change. It's actually bad if you never change. It means you aren't actually growing as a person. Be content with who you are and strive to be a better you."

agucwx,Thereisnowaythatwearealoneinthisuniverseright? We hear scientists talk about how there are millions of other planets and so many other solar systems. How can we possibly be the only living creatures alive?,"That is a stupid concept, I don't know why it's even a thing. The universe is believed to be infinite, there is no reason why we should expect to have encountered other life forms elsewhere in an infinite universe considering we know very little about the universe and can't even observe most of it. The paradox would be if we had miraculously already encountered anyone else despite the infinity of the universe."
agucwx,Thereisnowaythatwearealoneinthisuniverseright? We hear scientists talk about how there are millions of other planets and so many other solar systems. How can we possibly be the only living creatures alive?,The way I see it is that all the stuff that make up our existence is out there in other parts of space. So there has to be some other life forms out there. Maybe they've evolved differently than we have or maybe they haven't evolved enough to be as smart as we are. Who knows. But they gotta be out there.
agucwx,Thereisnowaythatwearealoneinthisuniverseright? We hear scientists talk about how there are millions of other planets and so many other solar systems. How can we possibly be the only living creatures alive?,"Preservation of what we have would be a good start. It's impossible to sustain life on our planet forever, due to the ballooning effect our sun will go through when it nears the end of it's life. Once it becomes a white dwarf, Mercury, Venus and Earth will be gone. Due to the sun's drastically reduced state, life in the solar system as a whole will become exceedingly difficult; if not impossible; to sustain. Our sights should not be on personal gain, but the long term preservation of everything we know, as well as the preservation of the possibilities we have open to us. Imagine the entire planet working together to push us further than we could ever hope to go with all of our pretty selfishness and wars."
agucwx,Thereisnowaythatwearealoneinthisuniverseright? We hear scientists talk about how there are millions of other planets and so many other solar systems. How can we possibly be the only living creatures alive?,"I feel like it's almost impossible that we're alone, but also almost impossible that other intelligent life out there is close enough to us to ever contact in any way."
agucwx,Thereisnowaythatwearealoneinthisuniverseright? We hear scientists talk about how there are millions of other planets and so many other solar systems. How can we possibly be the only living creatures alive?,"As others have implied, not all these are required for life. We don't need a large moon, our bodies could be adapted to handle larger differences in temperature. We've found life in much more inhospitable places in our oceans. We are bound to find life in all sorts of places in the Universe. Civilization on the other hand, may require a bit more hospitality, who knows, maybe not."

agy2gb,Whatconvincesyoutofinishlonggames. I’m bout to play a game called kingdom come deliverance. I want it to finally be the first game that I finish that is longer then 8 hours. What convinces you to finish long games.,It's all about the gameplay for me. I hate story driven games that arent fun (uncharted or the last of us for example). I need something I can jump into and just play. Dark souls is a great choice and I've put so much time into that game. Amplitude or guitar hero are great rhythm games that I've punched hundreds of hours into as well. Most RPGs I cant do. FF7 is an exception for me because i love how the materia system works with the turn based combat. It's also a good story imo which i usually dont care for.

My favorite Irish so far is Redbreast 12, my favorite Scotch are Glenmorangie 12 Lasanta in summer, Glenmorangie 12 Quinta Ruban in winter. I usually have ~ 20-25 whiskys at home. I just realized what I said about Lüttje Lage was a bit confusing: I am not from Hannover, the drink is local to that city.

I do see the appeal of spirits though, and so it too is on my list :D I'd like to see more craft places throughout Europe, I think such a homebrew scene is great to have anywhere! And the Lüttje Lage sounds distinct enough! I saw a guy place a shot glass full of some spirit into a lighter drink once, but I've yet to see a double barrel as you mentioned. I do! I love Northern Irish whiskeys, namely Bushmill's. They're a good brand, whom I've used to bake with as well (brownies, fudge, and others that I struggle to remember as of now). Are you a fan?

However except Munich they aren't really nice at they all suffered too much in the war. A beautiful city which wasn't harmed in WWII is Heidelberg and I heard Bamberg. We are going to travel to Bamberg this year to check. Apfelschorle (apple juice + sparkling water) is pretty common, apple juice as well. Apfelwein is more a regional thing. In our area it's beer, in my area there are at least three small local breweries. A thing I never understood is Korn, I don't know what northern Germans like about it, but it's common. And even though it's not ""local"" everyone knows ""Lüttje Lage"" (no idea how to translate this, lütt means small in dialect, so it would be roughly small bunch of drinks or so) in my region as I live in the Hannover area. It's a Korn + a specially brewed dark beer in a tiny glass. The idea is to drink both at once. Just from curiosity, stereotype demands that you like whisky, stereotypically. If so, what's your preferred one?"

Man I love the office!
ah2nja,"Whensomeonedoesafavourforme... When someone does a favour for me, it makes me uncomfortable and I always feel the urge to repay them almost instantly. I really don’t know why I feel this way, and I don’t think it’s healthy.","You could stand to moderate that feeling a little bit, but not too much. It's healthier than the alternative, which is to not feel very much obligation at all, when someone does you a favour. Regardless of what anyone says, almost everyone is keeping score. Even parents keep score with their adult children. The exceptions exist but they're so rare you may as well just assume everyone is keeping score. And even when you meet someone who really isn't, that's the person whose favours you want to repay the most anyway, so the point is moot. It sucks to be in the situation where you need a favour in the first place, and feeling the twinge if damaged pride just means you're someone to whom self-reliance is important. You'd be surprised how rare and valuable that is, actually. Most of us get sick to death of people who always take, and never feel the urge to give back. Maybe you're in the situation now where you find it difficult to do favours for others, and maybe you find yourself needing them a lot. I don't know, but being the type of person who keeps track of the favours done FOR you, and not BY you is a trait you shouldn't let go of. The time will come when you find yourself feeling like your debt is repaid, but people like you only feel that way once their contribution far exceeds the favours done for them, and that's what it means to be a contributor."

I really don’t know why I feel this way, and I don’t think it’s healthy.","No it's not healthy but at least you seem grateful. If you can't repay them in some small way immediately, just try to keep them in mind and maybe do something nice for them in the future. But...don't stress out about it. Saying thanks is usually enough depending on how big a favor."

So they just start eagerly explaining ""actually in the phantom menace.. "" in this nasally voice because it's just coming out of their head with no performance of any kind, which the rest of us do sub-consciously, having cultivated a charismatic persona."

ah3z7t,"Hasanyoneeverappliedfor,andgotten,ajobyouwereunder-qualifiedfor? Employed people of reddit: have you ever applied for, and gotten, a job you were under-qualified for? If so, what is your story? Any advice or pointers?","Yes. With a bachelors degree I applied for a receptionist job. I used my retail experience to back up my people’s experience. It seemed like a company that would recognize my talents and I could grow from within. I liked the company they liked me. I was told “we’re moving you into billing because as great as a receptionist as you are, we’re afraid you’ll get bored with the position and leave. I did that job for a year and a half. Got married, had to move for my husbands job, gave them notice, trained my replacement as best I could. Tried to make the transition as smooth as possible. Moved back to that area 1.5 years later. Called them up. They rehired me because of the impression I left. Learned some new skill sets. The bosses (first generation company) were not happy how my boss was treating the owner wife (our cfo). Fired him. Offered me head of HR. Told them I’m not qualified (later learned from my husband that was a terrible thing to say). Was told they would rather teach someone they trust than a new person to the company. Got the training. Got a giant raise, and now feel that I am working a position that I like and feel is to the standards of my ability. Tldr: find a company you want to work for. Take the position that you can, and show them what you’re worth. It can lead you to career path you want."

If so, what is your story? Any advice or pointers?","Great advice! Yeah, this job I’m looking at requires a 4 year degree and I currently have like 2 semesters to go, but the job itself is basically what I’m doing now but for more pay/different company. Education has always stressed me out because I know I have experience. It seems like when you’re first starting out in life you have one or the other and that usually bites you in the butt."
ah3z7t,"Hasanyoneeverappliedfor,andgotten,ajobyouwereunder-qualifiedfor? Employed people of reddit: have you ever applied for, and gotten, a job you were under-qualified for? If so, what is your story? Any advice or pointers?","I applied for a job that typically required you to have a years experience without close supervision; the listing specifically had said the experience was required but I submitted my resume anyways, and ended up being called in for an interview. They ended up liking me quite a bit at the interview and decided they'd like to have me despite of my lack of experience and were willing to jump through the extra hoops for the first year. So it was possible to hire me regardless they were just looking for people with more experience. The only advice I can really give is to prepare and be ready for any interview questions you can imagine for your given field and be as pleasant and personable as you can, the latter really goes a long way for any interview really. You can increase your chances of getting the interview with a really good resume, but tbh it's rare to get one, in my experience, without the minimum required qualifications. Then like I said be as prepared as you possibly can for the interview if you get one. The job I'm referring to was in mental health I got ~2 months after graduating college with a psych degree, which is rare for only a bachelor's degree. I was a QMHP-A in Virginia."

How do you guys focus on reading to actually absorb the information?,"As another mentioned, pacing or standing helps me focus better when reading sometimes. I also read out loud when it's possible.

How do you guys focus on reading to actually absorb the information?,"From my experience the only texts where I have trouble reading and find myself reading but not absorbing anything, are things in academia where the point is to obscure your point as much as possible. For those, I find it helpful to go slowly and group thoughts and concepts together, since the writers tend to use very long sentences with unnecessary words. I'll go and mentally make a note that ""okay, this part means this"" by cutting out fluff and breaking it down into basic ideas, making sure to separate them. For actual texts where writers consider their readers? I've never have a problem."

One thing I have learnt is the pictures people post can be very different from what they look like in person. It’s not only women that use filters. On the other side I have had some really fun nights. I have found that you need to lay down the ground rules right at the start."

I personally hate people that pity me, and I wouldn't want folks looking at me as if what I did was some sort of heroic tale of triumph. It is what it is; nothing more, nothing less.

I am about 7 months clean from heroin. I was hooked on pain pills for about 4 years and finally moved from snorting heroin to shooting it and did it for about a year. I was so sick of being broke, stealing from my family and breaking any ties I had, fighting every day with my fiance. I finally had a friend reach out to me and help me at one of my darkest times. I started going to treatment and here I am 7 months later. I haven't relapsed and I hope I don't. I'm so proud of you. It's really nice to hear that other people are doing well and making it through. It gives me the hope and strength I need to keep going as a secret addict, too. It's fucking hard, man. But keep it going and never look back but to make an example of it and to be proud of where you are now! You've got me if you ever want to talk about anything or you're having a rough day!"

And if they are how do they justify vaccinations causing autism if they’re not autistic themselves?,If their view is that vaccines are harmless most of the time then why do they loudly express their disapproval of them? And belittle parents who vaccinate their children? And disown their kids who decide to vaccinate themselves once they’re old enough?

ahli7a,AthoughtIhadtoday Are anti-vaxx mums actually vaccinated themselves? And if they are how do they justify vaccinations causing autism if they’re not autistic themselves?,Why don’t they let their kids get vaccinated then?
ahli7a,AthoughtIhadtoday Are anti-vaxx mums actually vaccinated themselves? And if they are how do they justify vaccinations causing autism if they’re not autistic themselves?,"Anti vaxxers think that you have a very slight risk of experiencing long term negative side effects from vaccines. They evaluate this risk to be superior than the risk of getting/experiencing long term negative effects from diseases. Science said it's the contrary, and I'm not even sure that even one case of vaccination-related long term negative side effect had ever been proved. But even in the anti-vaxxers view, most of the time vaccines are harmless. The argument ""you got vaccinated and did not become autistic"" does not work regardless of the matter. It is the same as ""my grandpa smoked 30 cigarettes a day his whole life and died at 100""."

ahn5g2,Doesanyoneelsehavetoremindthemslevestobreatheproberlythroughtheirnose? I catch myself breathing through my mouth all the time and have to remind myself to breath through my nose does anyone else do this or am I sorta a neanderthal.,It's happened before but for me it's blinking. I've went days maybe even a week or more rarely blinking if at all. I realized I had eye strain and had to blink more often.
ahn5g2,Doesanyoneelsehavetoremindthemslevestobreatheproberlythroughtheirnose? I catch myself breathing through my mouth all the time and have to remind myself to breath through my nose does anyone else do this or am I sorta a neanderthal.,You’re definitely not alone. I have a deviated septum and it’s hard for me to breathe through my nose. So I tend to breathe through my mouth because it’s easier.

Here's our other two kitties. Calcifer 'Sniff' is a tuxedo tabby and Tobert is a solid tabby. https://files.catbox.moe/xt6rn0.jpg Cheddar is 8 years old and has been my baby for half his life now, since I got him when he was 4 and being rehomed. His named was Sassy and he hated it. He is pretty damned sassy though, haha. Sniff is a feral born kitty, so he's more nervous. But he's very sweet and likes to cuddle...sometimes. He's 4. Tobert was dumped in a bush 3 winters ago as a kitten. He's the sweetest fellow and loves snuggles. Sleeps between my husband and I every night and is like a puppy. He turns 3 at the end of February."

My team all looks out for each other, my supervisor actually cares. The owner of the company is the most down-to-earth person. I felt this showed the most when my supervisor sat me down to talk about some things she'd noticed about the way I worked that concerned her. Rather than ignoring a potential issue and letting it get bigger over time, she cared enough to have a difficult conversation and call me on it when she saw it so I could try to make changes. To me, that says so much.. this place cares enough to have the hard conversations. To keep improving, keep commuicating. And the team stays a team because of it. No passive-aggressiveness or unresolved issues between people."

Maybe if your bombarding them with questions or are making the conversation seem forced (like you're asking just for the saske of asking) or always bring up that one topic because you have nothing else to talk with them about. Most people like talking about something they find interesting and are knowledgeable about; especially, if you are showing genuine interest. Most people, given the chance to talk will simply talk. Even when there's nothing to talk about they make small talk or gossip. If people are seeing you and ""know [they] shouldn't talk"" it is probably you.

I feel like people at work feel like I'm self-absorbed and it makes me come out as rude just because I'm one of those people who prefer to listen.,"I highly recommend that you watch the video, ""How to Win Friends and Influence People"" on YouTube. It is only eight minutes long and it is based on the old classic by Dale Carnegie. It really helped me a lot with my shyness because I never knew quite what to say. I went out one night years ago, and this guy started talking to me. It ended up that he had made a bet with his other friends that he could talk to the ""Ice Princess"". I'm not cold, I was just shy. We live in a world with other people and we really need to engage them in order to be successful personally or professionally."
ai9f7c,whatmakesapersonself-absorbed? I'm not a talker. I feel like people at work feel like I'm self-absorbed and it makes me come out as rude just because I'm one of those people who prefer to listen.,"Make small talk. Ask people how things are going. As them what they did for the weekend or what they have coming up. Pay attention to what they say and ask follow up questions. As time progresses, ask them about stuff they mentioned previously &amp;#x200B; For example, one of my co-workers always talks about studying. So I'll ask him questions about how is school going, what classes he's taking and how he likes them, how his tests went, if he gets a break during the holiday or if he's preppy for more classes, etc. &amp;#x200B; And I have kids. So my coworkers will ask how my kids are doing, if I'm taking them to (the big festival that's in town), what they're up to if it's a holiday &amp;#x200B;"

Knowing is the first step. I realise when I'm tired that I tune out when not talking. It's just pure effort. When you notice yourself going off then just dial it back.

aia5hb,Oscars. Hey I'm simply wondering are any of you excited for the oscars. Oh and what film do you think should win best picture? personally I think blacKkKlansman deserves it.,"And the me too movement started with good intentions but its turned into a movement where all men are being held responsible for the actions of the Harvey Weinsteins of the world. When a woman is raped while dressed a certain way we never blame her for it, but we target all men under toxic masculinity? If we do say she shouldn't have been dressed that way people get upset, as they should, because it was the rapists decision to defile this woman. Are you one of those people who says we should take the word ""alleged"" before ""rapist"" whenever a claim is made or do you think evidence should come to play? Should we just blindly believe with no evidence whatsoever? Because that's a dangerous game to play."

And 1 out of every 6 women in their lives is being raped? I know a lot more than 6 women and I dont know many who were raped. Rape is bad, obviously, but that statistic is nonsense."

aifui4,Justhadarootcanal... And the dentist broke part of one of the tools off inside my tooth. He wasn’t able to get it out so now I have to go to a specialist tomorrow. Never will I have another root canal.,"It wasn’t painful at all. The initial numbing shot wasn’t pleasant, but I had no pain during the procedure. I didn’t even know anything had gone wrong until it was over and he told me I’d need to see a specialist. TBH, I actually found the procedure itself to be a bit relaxing - no pain, just laying there with my eyes closed thinking about what I was going to do once I got home - that bit was nice. Now the numbness has worn off and I can’t even put pressure on it because whatever is in there feels like it’s stabbing me deep into my bone."
aifui4,Justhadarootcanal... And the dentist broke part of one of the tools off inside my tooth. He wasn’t able to get it out so now I have to go to a specialist tomorrow. Never will I have another root canal.,"From what I hear, generally you get a root canal when the root of your tooth is compromised. It is sensitive at first but eventually it dies and you feel nothing. But then itll get infected eventually, and the pain from that is apparently one of the worst pains imaginable, and you'll be begging for the root canal. The procedure isnt supposed to be much worse than a filling nowadays, it is the infection which causes the insanely painful reputation."

Never will I have another root canal.,"Oh god that is one of my nightmare scenarios. I hate having my teeth worked on. Side note, I'll be needing a root canal soon and I was wondering how the procedure went (minus the tool breaking off inside of your gums). Was it very painful? Thats my biggest concern."

I've had financial issues with my dad before. I didn't know that he was going through something. I found out he was going through things like [casinos](https://vegascasino.io/promotions/make-your-dreams-come-true?utm_source=cc-vg-3), relationships, his frustrations and that's when I've seen him differently.

It keeps my neck warm in the freezing cold falls and winters here. When I cut it it's usually a longish bob. So not a really radical change.

I'm currently letting it grow and almost walked into the hair salon to cut it but walked away last minute.",I'm female and the longest I let my hair grow was to my butt. I got so many compliments on it. People would stop me to tell me how much they liked it even in the grocery store. I cut it a couple summers ago. Its now down to about the middle of my back. I'm thinking of cutting it just a little. I love long hair but it does get to be a pain. Mine grows really fast. Think its all the peanut butter I eat -- the protein. I don't eat a lot of meat so I get the protein from that.

I'm currently letting it grow and almost walked into the hair salon to cut it but walked away last minute.","I have an impulsive side. When I'm feeling anxious, it manifests itself as an impulse. When I was 19, I randomly got an impulse to cut my hair (\~1.5' long at that point). Cut maybe 5"" off one day, wasn't happy. Cut another 2"" off the next day, still didn't feel right. Finally I just cut it all off and gave myself a pixie. I felt FREED. I loved having short hair for a long time. I have really thick hair so it was a literal weight off my shoulders. Kept cutting it for about 1.5 years, until I decided I missed messy buns and braids (they were my shit when it was long), and being able to wear beanies (not very flattering on my particular face without hair). I'm now 22 and still growing it out! It's almost as long as it was before I cut it, but I can't wait for it to grow longer!! Even up until a couple weeks ago, I was having an intense internal debate as to whether I wanted to cut it again, just because it'd be so easy. Then I decided I wasn't going to throw all that waiting away lol"

Even as i think back i realise that a lot of jokes by the most popular users were probably stolen, it was still a pretty vibrant and fun community where anyone just post anything they wanted. I also accidentally read my first fanfiction there, it was 1D fanfics of all things. They really did have something going on with the original stories, dang. I was constantly using it from the age of 12-13 too! Shame that the app is defunct and has been for a long time. I wonder how users like ilovecorn or some of my favourite writers were doing. Did manage to track one of them down in wattpad though. It will be great if theres a way to just, make a post and gather as many users that remembers the app as possible. like a nice little reunion.

I remember there being so many twisted stories about rape and incest which might of been a reason why it got deleted? Sad thing is there were so many other amazing stories. Ahhhhh I miss it so much!

This should do it.","Pretty good? Right now I'm on a bulk, trying to put on mass and muscle for a superhero cosplay - and as someone who used to struggle with anorexia and was dangerously underweight its been one of the most challenging things I've ever done. I still get that nagging voice in the back of my mind criticizing me whenever I feel fat gathering around my midsection. But I've made a lot of progress! I still have a long way to go, but I've come a long way, too. Its incredible going to the gym and getting stronger and stronger every time - and I'm fixated on my goal! Its a REALLY nerdy one but I have my eyes on the prize! I just can't lose focus or succumb to fat-gaining fears. Seeing my lifts increase, seeing my chest fill out, feeling my arms straining against the sleeves of my old shirt - its pretty special. And when my convention rolls around in November it will all have been worth it."

I love writing and would be very interested in finding a sort of partner that i could give and receive feedback and constructive criticism on,Fun fact I also want to start a novel too! So the plot goes like this. A boy named Allan lives with his mom in a apartment in Taurus which is a made up city in 3050. So his dad has gone missing as well as his best friend Collon. Allan one day finds a time machine in the basement and teleports backs to when his dad was killed. It turns out that Collon is still alive and was the one that killed the dad. Collon finds out that Allan videotaped him killing the dad so he breaks the recording and traps him in the year 3000. Allan tries to fix the broken recording and tries to get back to 3050 and serve justice for his dad. Collon goes to the year 3050 and disguises himself completely as a different person.

You got any general tips for exam or exam prep? I'll be sure to reply","Exam Story: So I was failing pre-calc and the instructor let me take a make up exam to get my grade above 50%. I did what any normal person would do and studied past assignments and quizzes with a few practice assignments.(I would study the tests but he wouldn't let us keep them). Seeing how this was a exam on the whole semester I figured it be easier questions or ones similar to the tests we had so I didn't bother studying stuff we didn't have a test, assignment or quiz on. So I get there and pretty hyped for doing this test, I'd be passing pre-calc finally! Then the test came. EVERY FUCKING QUESTION WAS ON MATERIAL WE BARELY COVERED. They were all new and none were easy at the slightest. He chose the hardest questions out of the book. Not to mention that we were allowed a formula sheet for every test but this fucking guy gave me the same specifications on making a formula sheet(one page double sided) for THE ENTIRE SEMESTER. So I jammed as many formulas i'd needed for the test but it was all in vain as the test was all new question so I didn't include their formulas that i'd thought we wouldn't need for the test. &amp;#x200B; So that's how I ended my pre-calc last year and now am retaking it with a different instructor, who is ruff but at least don't fuck with you like the other guy did. &amp;#x200B; rant over."

Could be pseudoscience, but it works for me."

ajp2ht,"Ican’ttextinmydreams. I’ve noticed that if in my dreams I’m sending a text to somebody I’m always struggling to spell the words correctly and that there is no autocorrect occurring, has anyone else noticed this? Lol","When I first learned about lucid dreaming this was one of the things I saw mentioned in multiple places as a way to recognize you’re in a dream. Not text messaging specifically, but just text in general will be pretty jumbled if not just totally illegible nonsense in a dream. Another example I can remember is light switches and other switches/buttons not working. I haven’t had a lucid dream in a long time, I think the meds I take affect my sleep too much, I don’t ever remember any dreams at all. But when I was able to, whenever I was dreaming and had a moment in which I realized I must be dreaming, as stupid as this sounds, I would just start running around in a small circle really fast in my “dream body” and sometimes that would allow me to remain in the dream lucidly. I read about the spinning method somewhere, I didn’t come up with it haha but it’s the only method that’s ever worked for me. But the text or light switch thing have never triggered one for me, it’s always been realizing that details of the location I’m at in the dream is way off from reality or details about it change suddenly. I always just start flying around like Superman when I can do it. Last time I had one I flew around Wal*Mart until I woke up."

ajs9o6,Sadatthesametimedaily Does anyone else experience this? I feel just so unmotivated and sad around 1 o’clock nearly every day. I can’t figure out why. Have any tips? It’s really strange,"My best guess is hormones. I was taking some female supplements to help with stuff and I’d take one in the morning then was instructed to take the other one when I felt my afternoon energy drop. (don’t know your gender, so may not apply) Taking supplements (vitamin B’s help energy), drinking more water and less caffeine could help. Don’t know if you drink coffee but sometimes it affects people in the afternoon."
ajs9o6,Sadatthesametimedaily Does anyone else experience this? I feel just so unmotivated and sad around 1 o’clock nearly every day. I can’t figure out why. Have any tips? It’s really strange,"I was gonna say blood sugar or circadian rhythm related. If at the same time every day you start feeling bleh, consider your routine. Look at eating habits, sleeping, etc. That might just be an energy lull for you based on where everything else is falling. Lotsa people get sleepy around 2-2:30 for example because of their circadian rhythms and that after lunch lull."

It’s really strange,"If it’s always around the same time, and you have a pretty regular schedule outside of that, it’s probably just blood sugar related. If you’re blood sugar levels take a dive you tend to feel not so great- anxious, confusion, fatigue, shakiness."

ajxjym,"I’msotiredandstressed Last night, I was up until half past two finishing calculus homework - it took me about 20 pages to get through it all! And I have a history paper due in tomorrow. How are you managing your stress?","Good luck getting through this challenge my friend! Here are techniques I have used to maintain physical and relative mental wellbeing during, at times 80 hour weeks: The dive reflex getting water splashed over your face or taking a quick shower can give you some temporary relief. A quick bit of exercise for a few minutes, but you don’t want to fatigue yourself. Really use your relaxation time with the same intensity as your working time. If its time to sleep get off of electronics and lay there. I give myself permission to let loose and fall asleep and then I relax all of my muscles and let my mind go. A white noise machine helps to avoid things that might wake you prematurely. You can use melatonin to help you to sleep. Stretching before sleep also helps you to relax. Maintain like 2 nalgenes a day of hydration. Eat enough but avoid having only sugary stuff that is super tempting because you will crash. Spread your caffiene out instead of going all in in the morning only. I do 25% am 25% brunch 50% after lunch for caffiene intake; probably easier on your body this way too."

I totally agree with that, given that it can kind of feel like nothing has happened if you don't signify it to yourself somehow. I think going out to dinner to celebrate is a fine alternative though, if you don't want to walk! But definitely worth having some sort of 'closing ceremony' for yourself. :-)"

True happiness in your worklife requires a delicate balance - you need to be satisfied with your salary and benefits, you need to be interested and engaged in the work you do with realistic performance targets, but most importantly, you need to enjoy spending time with the people you're working with. I've had 2 out of 3 time and time again, and it was only when I found the right mix of all 3 that I started to thrive. I guess that's my secret to creating a comfortable work life. Don't be afraid to walk away from 'almost good enough'. Oh, and smaller companies usually offer the best work / life balance - VERY important."

I was telling her that I don't really know whether I LIKE like a guy until I get to know him. You know, it's not all about looks. So she gets sassy and points out this scruffy, messy, insecure-looking guy in a long trenchcoat that's way too big for him. She asks me if I'd date *him* and I roll my eyes at her. It took us 20 more years to get started- a winding road brought us together- but we have three kids now. One day I was cleaning out a closet and found the trenchcoat, and that was when the memory hit me: definitely the same guy. I asked him about it and he said the coat had belonged to his uncle. They'd been close and he'd passed away unexpectedly, and he ended up wearing the coat for a few months while he grieved."

ak74i9,Letshaveachat!&lt;3Anytopic:D Im a little drunk right now. Im currently at a party (Everyones asleep now sadly). Anyone up for a chat about anything? Hope you all have a good day &lt;3,"I live in a small rural country side town, in England. There are at most 4 or 5 regular homeless people on our streets. They all know me very well (compared to everyone else). I am often alone on the streets 11pm+ and often start a chat with them or have a cigarrete. 2018 was the worst year on record for me, and the best actually. But a lot of shit happened, and I ended up using cocaine daily for a while. When I am high, often my friends would be busy/school etc, so I had to ski solo. I hate doing that, and would rather split 50/50 while im paying 100%. This christmas, I wanted to be nice. So I took one of the homeless to a resturant, and told him ""I dont have a lot of money, but I want to buy you a hot meal. Can you just get whatever meal you fancy, but no expensive drink etc?"" Or to some degree. Previously I had gone to Tesco to buy him a water bottle, baby wipes and gave him about 1/3 of my baccy left. He understood that I didnt have the money to spend on our meal, and we both only got a small roast dinner. Sadly saying, if I were not to be on cocaine at that time, I wouldnt have taken him for a meal. But I am super glad I did."

Just take in the night life, feel the wind, taste the zeitgeist, observe the things around you and just marvel in the fact that you are you, and that everything and person in your proximity has a story as complex as your own, and exist in the same place and time as you. Wonder in amazement and just realise how insignificant you are on a global scale; you're a grain of sand at the beach, a star in a galaxy, but you are you and this one moment, this one day, how ever many years ago, was designated as the beginning of your life."

akq2xc,"MayaAngelouoncesaid... ""people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel."" What do you guys think of this quote, is it true?","Studies (fairly sure one made it to the front even) have concluded something along the lines of: presenting facts was less effective than being amiable for changing minds. My reading between the lines is people operate more from emotion than facts. We are more heart than mind. Similarly, https://www.npr.org/2014/03/04/285580969/when-it-comes-to-vaccines-science-can-run-into-a-brick-wall Same applies to other hot button issues such as that ""planetary thermal increase thing,"" ""support for a leaders who have no true policy (vacillators who ride mob energy),"" and as linked previously ""preventive medication practices."" There is also the observation of PR campaigns for anything (such as advertising). Content of campaign information does not matter, only the emotions invoked. Associate a person with theft and it leaves a mark on them. For instance a headline that reads, ""Florida Man Did Not Steal Priceless Family Jewels"" can still be damaging. It invokes the attached emotions for each of those words within the same thought process/conceptual space, and the more intense words induce stronger emotions. Essentially the tangible and concrete possess a fraction of the influence of human emotion."

My point to him was that not everyone experiences the same things the same way and that getting rid of the environment that breeds the mentality of gang violence and drug dealing as the only ways to ""make it""is more important than just saying that ""these people are obviously choosing this life for themselves"""

aky8ji,"Whendidyouguysdecideyoursignatures?Howdidyoucomeupwithit? I came am up with mine when I was quite young and have been using it since, however it feels quite juvenile to use now as it's just a variation on my initals.",Mine has developed in the last two years that I've been in my office job. It used to change all the time but now I have to sign multiple documents per day and it's literally just the fastest way to write it. My first name is legible but my surname is pretty much just a big ol squiggle. Sometimes I hate it and think it looks like I'm trying too hard to have a signature but with the right pen looks kind of snazzy?
aky8ji,"Whendidyouguysdecideyoursignatures?Howdidyoucomeupwithit? I came am up with mine when I was quite young and have been using it since, however it feels quite juvenile to use now as it's just a variation on my initals.",Mine is my first name initial then my last name. I swear they’re different every time I write them though lol
aky8ji,"Whendidyouguysdecideyoursignatures?Howdidyoucomeupwithit? I came am up with mine when I was quite young and have been using it since, however it feels quite juvenile to use now as it's just a variation on my initals.",Mine is very similar to my mum's as a result of signing permission slips myself in high school. Once I started signing my own things I added my first initial to it and it drifted to be a bit less cursive style and more squiggly.

To cite Albus Dumbledore,“Of course it is happening inside your head, Harry, but why on earth should that mean that it is not real?”","Thanks for your response. To address your concerns about *my* own personal moral compass, I personally don’t enjoy knowing I’ve brought harm to another person. I don’t like the idea of stealing, even if I know I’ll never get caught. If I ever made a terrible mistake by cheating on a significant other, I’m sure I would be plagued with guilt about it. Even now I’m plagued with guilt about ways I’ve hurt people in the past. But these feelings of moral obligation, a moral compass, a moral duty, a conscience, a sense of right and wrong, or whatever you want to call it, that I have- they’re just my gut feelings. They’re my emotions. I would not call them facts. As you said it, they are “My personal inner set of integrity, character, morality.” If someone’s principles differ from mine, or if another country has values which differ from those of my home country, I would not call those other principles and values “wrong.” Maybe I would say “that doesn’t sit right with me” or “I disagree with that” or even “that feels wrong to me.” And for the despicable, I would say “that makes me sick“ or “that horrifies me“or “that breaks my heart.” But if a person thinks that stealing is OK, are they *wrong*? Thinking that 2+2 is 5, that’s wrong. Thinking that the sun revolves around the earth, that’s wrong. Thinking it’s OK to hurt another person? Well… That certainly feels wrong to me. But that’s just how I feel about it. I’m only one person."

To cite Albus Dumbledore,“Of course it is happening inside your head, Harry, but why on earth should that mean that it is not real?”","Sorry for l8 reply, I'm not a lot on reddit. Essentially, what I meant is that every person's truth is basically limited to how they percieve and have percieved the world so far. ""My truth"", so to speak, is quite different from a Somalian child-worker, seeing as ""my truth"" involves... Coca-Cola, which a Somalian child-worker has never heard of. If an orthodox christian knows that there's a God, then God is part of ""their truth"", which is strictly limited to them. Imo, a ""truth"", in this case, is merely what our individual minds can observe/fathom, because there is no no real objective truth that a conscious mind can understand. Look at it this way: a tree doesn't actually look like a tree, it merely looks like how your brain interprets the photons that bounce from it to your eye. In the same way, a truth isn't really a ""truth"", but rather our minds' interpretation of the world. Sorry for the rambling"
al0mlq,"Doyouthinkthattheobjectivetruthchangesbasedonwhatwebelieve? In other words, do you think believing something makes it true? To cite Albus Dumbledore,“Of course it is happening inside your head, Harry, but why on earth should that mean that it is not real?”","How do I know it is wrong to do something to another human being? Whether it be stealing, inflicting pain, or causing death? Well, sometimes it depends on the situation. If I snuck into the home of my neighbor, a Sweet Little Old lady, and took her grocery money from her purse, that would be wrong of me. How do I justify that claim? Let's ignore that we live in a nation of laws and that the law says stealing is bad. Forget that. You are asking about my moral compass. My personal inner set of integrity, character, morality. When it comes down to it, I do not want to steal from my neighbor because I know how hard she works for her money. I know how hard *I* work for my money. And I can know how bad I would feel if someone stole what little I have. Years ago I read this study about how thieving was done on a larger scale if it could be done without ever really seeing whose goods you were taking. Most people won't take money from their neighbor. Most burglaries are done at people's homes the burglar does not know. Same thing with criminals that use the threat of violence, like a hold-up. And when the crooks DO know who they are stealing from it is usually done as revenge for some earlier rift. But these pale in comparison to people who routinely rook large amounts of money. People embezzle huge piles of cash. But they have never really met the victims. White collar crimes hurt far more people on a grander scale. Usually, all of these criminals have justified it in their minds that it is okay. Then there is the person who steals out of desperation. They know what they are doing violates their code. But they steal anyway, because they have a child who is crying due to hunger. I feel that it is Society that is at fault, in those cases, not the thieving parent. I have a question for *you:* Do you not feel that hurting others is wrong? To my mind, it is abundantly clear that morality matters, and that hurting others for convenience sake is wrong. I do not want to live in a Mad Max sort of world. We have seen, we ARE seeing what happens when some people decide that it is Coolio to lie, to cheat, to steal, and even to kill, when it suits them. As for countries, well, that is a question now, isn't it? There is NO country that has ever existed that gets it all right 100% of the time. And there are some countries that get it wrong almost 100% of the time. There is plenty of evidence. Google it. Go to library and read about it. Ask people who have lived through hard times, in places where violence was done. Use your imagination. What would YOU do if confronted by such times? How would YOU react if the gun was placed in YOUR hands, aimed at the head of the man at your feet whose only crime was believing in a different form of God? What would you do if, while at work you found you could skim a bit of money off the profits and no one would be the wiser? What would you do, if your small child annoyed you and no one else would know that you smacked them to keep them quiet? What would you do if a beautiful person made it clear they wanted to have sex with you, and your partner waiting for you at home would never know? Would you cheat? I am not sure if you are asking these questions rhetorically, to engender discussion, or if you really are confused and might be lacking in empathy for your fellow humans. I suggest you follow the law and err on the side of caution if you cannot figure it out for yourself."

I make a very nice six figure income but I'm not risking any significant loss to pick up the dollar. From a financial standpoint, it would be a poor decision not to pick up the dollar."

I’m just getting over one recently right now, and although I’m really glad I’m finally over it because it’s caused enough stress for me as it is, part of me wishes it was still a thing because I kind of miss the feeling.

alhz4u,"I'mfreakingoutbecauseofmyupcomingtestpaper My exam is on 2nd Feb and I have studied hard for it. However, competition is tough here for jobs and I'm freaking out thinking, what If I fuck it up! I'm Indian.","Yes.. I have practiced a lot for the numerical questions. The paper is computer based where either you have to choose one from the options or enter the final answer. So, the process of arriving to the answer doesn't matter. However, I understand what you are trying to say. Some answers can be derived using the units or as such. My problem here is mental. I always had had a casual approach in life which led me to current scenario. Now that I'm serious for something, there is this little devil called, performance anxiety dancing on my head."

However, competition is tough here for jobs and I'm freaking out thinking, what If I fuck it up! I'm Indian.","I can’t say I’m knowledgeable of your exact situation but i will tell you some advice from my time in university. If there is a problem that you don’t know the numerical answer to, the best way to display your understanding is to turn the problem into an equation and solve for the missing variable. You may not have the correct answer, however you will still be demonstrating your knowledge as opposed to just stopping in the middle. Persistence speaks a lot to some employers."

It may feel really embarrassing, really awkward, maybe the entire room stared at you, maybe someone might possibly remember later on down the line, but generally people are focused more on themselves than other people. tl;dr everyone is the main character of their own story, so they're thinking more about themselves than what you do, so get out there and carpe diem."

alqqim,"WhydoesChinablockpeoplefromaccessingthingsontheinternet? I'm curious to know more about why and what types of things the Chinese people can't access. Is it all social networking, I think YouTube is definitely blocked but why?","This is a good answer. This is also why, even before the internet, all media is tightly controlled. For instance, I knew someone from China studying medicine in the US when the Tiananmen Square protests occurred. He was concerned what would happen when he returned, as he had seen non-Chinese-state-controlled coverage. I also regularly sent news items to Chins at a previous job and had a list of things that were not allowed. Even with that list, a large number of things were rejected. I was also astonished how many people in the US were surprised at this. One client asked me, ""How can they do that?"" I replied that freedom of the press isn't global. So this is why if you live in a country that at least claims democratic ideals and see media, press, and even basic factual information attacked and threatened, you should be deeply concerned."
alqqim,"WhydoesChinablockpeoplefromaccessingthingsontheinternet? I'm curious to know more about why and what types of things the Chinese people can't access. Is it all social networking, I think YouTube is definitely blocked but why?","Beside the blocking, there are social media and search engines that are simply more popular there. Idk how this came to be (probably a lot due to blocking other social media, such as facebook). By giving replacements, people are not really driven to bypass the blocking (which is possible with vpn or tor, i think) Mainly they are blocked so the propaganda works. They can effectively control what info people get, thus controlling public opinion. Think of how youtube (and other video hosting/streaming) is important when people show police violence. Or how important social media/chat is for organizing (e.g. not that recent anymore - but the arab spring was organized a lot through social media and encrypted chat. Whatsapp is encrypted for example) If you think about it, in the west is not *that* different (it is different, but i dont think that much), especiay for non tech savy people (read: elderly) who trust 'what the computer/internet says'. I just found out, there is a wiki page with a comprehensive list https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Websites_blocked_in_mainland_China Also, iirc, there were talks about google being allowed back in China if it allowed to block certain webistes (i dont remember what google decided)."
alqqim,"WhydoesChinablockpeoplefromaccessingthingsontheinternet? I'm curious to know more about why and what types of things the Chinese people can't access. Is it all social networking, I think YouTube is definitely blocked but why?",There are several reasons they censor the internet ranging from control of information or blocking things they feel could have a negative influence on their population or governance to wanting their own companies to be the ones used and to make money instead of foreign ones.
alqqim,"WhydoesChinablockpeoplefromaccessingthingsontheinternet? I'm curious to know more about why and what types of things the Chinese people can't access. Is it all social networking, I think YouTube is definitely blocked but why?","That's how authoritarianism works. You present *your* version of Reality, and you block any other view. Any view that is not your own is wrong -- not just factually, but morally and **legally**. Transparency is the absolute enemy of authoritarianism. I'll recommend that you read *1984* (:"

Perhaps it happened here? I'm not saying the parents are innocent, they failed their child.

I tend to enjoy things in waves and then suddenly stop enjoying them for something else and repeat. The most common ones would be reading, anime, video games, and YouTube. Though film and television find their way in occasionally. So I'll go anywhere from 1-6 months only enjoying one thing, then I can't stand it anymore and only enjoy another thing. I don't tend to enjoy the others when it's not their turn. I don't know, it's kinda weird. I get obsessive with my entertainment I guess?"

alz6hx,"Whatwassomethingstupidyoubelievedwhenyoung? I thought Muslims and Sikhs were ninjas...yeah. 6 to 8 years old, hijab, turbans or cloth like clothing with hoods stuff like that, Small me was a dumbass.",It stemmed from the fact that as a child I lived next to what amounted to a heavy equipment graveyard. When I was little I would play in this boneyard of old dump trucks and backhoes and shit. I buried a toy dump truck and the next day a worn out old dump truck got parked right above it. I figured it out when I was a bit older

am2tns,dream a couple nights ago i had a dream where i was on the bus to school and it crashed and i was the only survivor. all my friends were dead in the dream. does anyone know what this means?,"Maybe the dream is telling you theyre not really your friends. Think of dreams as an entity talking to you. That entity is ULTIMATELY you but its a higher aspect of you. “Higher” as in dimensional. When you dream its your “higher” self talking to you. Telling you things through symbols and scenarios and metaphors. Thats how the 5th dimension works. Now we know what we know, what do YOU think your “higher” self is telling you with that dream. Trust me its very hard to interpret, but ONLY you can decipher it. Bc thats your personal life. So idk dont think about it too hard. Think about what kind of person you are in the higher aspect."

But that’s just my opinion. Last night I had a dream/nightmare about people I’ve never seen before in my life. In the dream two people where underground carrying a boulder on their backs to make for shade. And then out of nowhere a giant white gorilla( like the one from the movie Rampage, even tho I’ve never seen the movie) breaks the ceiling. The two people dropped their bolder and ran toward a tunnel leading outside. The gorilla breaks through and just reaches his hand out and grabs the two and gets away. I woke up in shock and a little paranoid because I thought it was the strangest thing to imagine in a dream."

If I had that dream, it would mean something different because I have different perceptions of: school, my friends, school busses and whatever else happened in your dream. Think about how the dream made you feel, is it possible you're anxious about losing your friends?"

And this was the ground floor, so we're only going up. Some guy waltzes up and presses up again, then looks around like he did us some kind of favor. And the elevator did not magically show up on the second press. Unrelated, but still elevator-relevant, but one of the elevators announced ""Fourth floor, going up,"" and I swear it sighed heavily afterwards. Like it was sick and tired of the up and down shenanigans it did all day."

This could leave to single riders being starved out of an elevator during peak hours.

It is about a writer that moves to a cabin after his wife passes away. This cabin is surrounded by woods and there is a legend attached to it. A legend about a wolf-like creature called Silver Majesty. To pass the time, and try and distract himself from thinking too much about his late wife, he tries to find out more about the creature and comes across a mysterious abandoned cabin known to the locals as The Butterfly Cabin."

amdngz,"I'mofficiallyanadultnow. Woke from a nightmare this morning. All of my tires were flat and wouldn't inflate. No monsters or bad guys, just regular, old grown-up problems. Who else has these *adult-ing* nightmares?","Use the parking break. But if it's not working as well... Turn on the hazard lights and then flick the key between the ACC and ON positions, without turning it all the way to that springy position when the starter spins the engine. It takes kinetic energy to start the car without the assistance of a starter, so over time you will come to a complete stop. But I don't know if that will work with an automatic. Now you know how to slow down a car with no breaks. But probably only a manual one."

I am still with my first girlfriend and we have been together for 8 years now. During that time, there was a period of about 2.5 years where we lived in different countries and the relationship was a long distance one. It was difficult but it did not change how we felt about each other and it did not get in the way of our relationship."

Definitely not easy. But if the person is worth it then it’s worth it. I’ve been in one for close to three years now. She’s from the Czech Republic and I’m in the US. It’s been a lot of video calling, scraping together money to buy plane tickets whenever I have a break from school, and making the time to see each other over the summer and holidays. We dated for a couple months when we first met with the knowledge that it would become long distance soon. We decided to give it a try. The longest stint we’ve had together was late September to early January. Can’t imagine life without her and we’re getting married this summer after I finish grad school."

I'll watch adverts from the 80's and just wish that things were more like that now. For example, adverts back then was more business-like and the emphasis was trying to sell a product without too much theater. Now it seems to be the norm where adverts have to be flashy and include really bad music. Most of the ones that come on before a YouTube video I just mute. Very rarely do I see an advert and not think, ""God, it's so cringeworthy."" &amp;#x200B; Another example is back then adverts, during the holidays, focused on the season as well as selling a product. When I watch a Christmas themed advert from back in the day I get a sense of nostalgia for a time period in which I've never lived. Now seasonal adverts are less about the season, and just using the season as an excuse to sell more stuff. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;"

I thought that too but at the end of the day when the sun goes down, my happiness is first and I would much rather be surrounded by people who know how important my happiness is than people who are more invested in themselves. But then again it doesn’t always mean to completely cut somebody off, everybody can change for the better. I had a friend who I had to cut ties with because they got deep into drugs and tried to get me into them with them. They actually sent me a text a few weeks ago apologizing and asking for help and of course I was there for them and we are slowly building our friendship back up again."

The committee had probably already had all this stuff planned and had the rehearsals for halftime done a dozen times or so, then we petition that. Instead of pouting that they didn't scrap their plans that had been in the works for a long time now and cobble something together that we would've hated even more than what they actually did, why not petition for it next year? Then they'll have more time to actually put on a good show. Not saying it wasn't a let down, but ignoring the reason why it was done is just childish. Plus, Adam Levine doesn't have the voice for Rock music."

Was a bit hungover from yesterday, so I decided to just relax and do nothing in particular. Just watched some Youtube, played some videogames and that's about it. Felt kinda bad about myself because of it actually. My mother threw a tantrum during dinner because it didn't turn out that well (meat was a bit too raw, and the sauce a bit watery). Brought down everybody's mood for the whole evening because of it. Also feeling a bit lonely as well lately! And kinda losing motivation to do my part time job (Also due to an unannounced wage-cut by 66%) and math course. Apart from that everything's going fine though haha. At least I still do sports every 1-2 days, so that's that."
